      "extendedDescription": [
        "You treat survival like warfare because that's exactly what it is. The nuclear apocalypse didn't just destroy civilization - it created a battlefield where only the tactically minded survive. Your ability to assess threats, organize defenses, and lead others through crisis situations makes you a natural commander in this new world.",
        "Your strength lies in seeing the bigger picture while managing critical details. You understand that survival isn't just about finding food and water - it's about building sustainable communities, establishing trade relationships, and creating defensive strategies against both environmental hazards and human threats. You think in terms of supply chains, patrol routes, and strategic advantages.",
        "Other survivors gravitate toward your leadership because you make decisions based on logic rather than emotion. You're willing to make the hard choices that keep groups alive, even when those choices are unpopular. Your ability to maintain discipline and focus during chaos has saved countless lives and created pockets of stability in the wasteland.",
        "Your challenge is balancing tactical necessity with human compassion. Sometimes your military-style approach can alienate potential allies or create internal tension within your group. However, when the shit hits the fan and difficult decisions need to be made, everyone looks to you to guide them through the storm."

      "shortDescription": "You believe that humanity's strength lies in cooperation. Your ability to bring people together and maintain group morale makes you essential for rebuilding civilization from the ashes.",
      "extendedDescription": [
        "In a world where trust is scarce and betrayal can mean death, you've chosen the harder path of building bridges instead of walls. Your natural ability to read people, mediate conflicts, and foster cooperation has made you the heart of whatever survivor community you join. You understand that long-term survival depends on more than just individual skills - it requires functioning human societies.",
        "Your talent for organization and resource sharing has kept groups alive when selfish hoarding would have doomed everyone. You've learned to balance individual needs with group survival, creating fair rationing systems and work assignments that prevent the internal conflicts that destroy most survivor communities. People trust you because you consistently put the group's welfare above your own immediate interests.",
        "What makes you invaluable is your ability to maintain hope and humanity in impossible circumstances. When others become hardened and cynical, you remind people what they're fighting to preserve. Your emotional intelligence helps you identify potential leaders, resolve personality conflicts, and integrate new members without destabilizing existing group dynamics.",
        "Your weakness is sometimes being too trusting or optimistic about human nature. Your desire to help everyone can put you and your group at risk when dealing with raiders, con artists, or people who've been broken by the apocalypse. However, your ability to rebuild the social bonds that make civilization possible ensures that whatever emerges from this disaster will be worth living in."

      "shortDescription": "You've learned that in the nuclear wasteland, the only person you can truly rely on is yourself. Your self-sufficiency and independence have kept you alive when groups have fallen apart.",
      "extendedDescription": [
        "The apocalypse confirmed what you always suspected - other people are the real danger. While others waste energy on group dynamics and emotional needs, you've focused on becoming completely self-sufficient. Your ability to survive alone in hostile territory, make quick decisions without consensus, and avoid the complications that destroy group cohesion has kept you alive when larger communities have collapsed.",
        "Your survival strategy is built on mobility, adaptability, and minimal dependencies. You've learned to travel light, think fast, and trust your instincts above all else. When situations turn bad, you can disappear into the wasteland without worrying about others slowing you down or making noise that attracts threats. Your knowledge of solitary survival techniques is unmatched.",
        "What others see as paranoia, you recognize as healthy caution. You've watched too many good people die because they trusted the wrong person or stayed loyal to failing groups. Your emotional detachment might seem cold, but it's what allows you to make rational decisions when others are paralyzed by sentiment or social obligations.",
        "Your challenge is recognizing when cooperation might actually benefit you without compromising your independence. Some situations require teamwork, and your reluctance to work with others can limit your options or force you into unnecessarily dangerous solo missions. However, your self-reliance ensures that you'll be among the last survivors standing when the dust settles."

      "extendedDescription": [
        "In the post-nuclear economy where bottle caps might be worth more than gold, you've become the ultimate resource specialist. Your talent for finding valuable supplies in unlikely places, preserving resources in harsh conditions, and negotiating favorable trades has made you one of the most successful survivors in the wasteland. You understand that information, supplies, and connections are the new currency.",
        "Your survival strategy revolves around creating value and building trade networks. While others fight over scraps, you've learned to identify what people actually need versus what they think they need. Your knowledge of preservation techniques, hidden caches, and supply routes gives you advantages that combat skills alone can't match. You're the person others come to when they need something specific.",
        "What sets you apart is your long-term thinking about resource management. You don't just collect supplies - you understand depreciation, trade values, and market dynamics in a world where traditional economics no longer apply. Your ability to anticipate shortages and stockpile accordingly has made you indispensable to multiple survivor communities.",
        "Your weakness is sometimes prioritizing profit over people, leading to ethical dilemmas when desperate survivors can't afford what they need to live. Your focus on material wealth can also make you a target for raiders or create resentment within communities. However, your resource management skills are essential for any group that wants to thrive rather than merely survive in the new world."

When other survivors are still trying to apply pre-war logic to post-war problems, you've already shifted gears and found new solutions. Your mental flexibility has been the key to your survival.",
        "Your approach to the wasteland is experimental and opportunistic. You're not locked into any single survival strategy - instead, you read situations as they develop and adjust your tactics accordingly. This has allowed you to thrive in diverse environments, from urban ruins to rural wastelands, and work effectively with different types of survivor groups.",
        "What makes you valuable is your ability to learn quickly from both successes and failures. You don't get stuck mourning the old world or fixated on how things 'should' work. Instead, you embrace the new reality and find ways to turn challenges into advantages. Your optimism and creativity inspire others to think outside the box when facing impossible situations.",
        "Your challenge is sometimes lacking the deep specialization that extreme situations demand. Your jack-of-all-trades approach might leave you less prepared for specific threats like radiation poisoning or combat situations. However, your adaptability ensures that you'll find ways to survive scenarios that would doom more rigid thinkers."

      "extendedDescription": [
        "The nuclear apocalypse is as much a psychological war as a physical one, and you're winning on both fronts. Your mental toughness has been forged in the crucible of unimaginable horror, allowing you to function effectively when others are paralyzed by trauma, despair, or panic. You've learned to compartmentalize emotions and focus on what needs to be done, regardless of how terrible the circumstances become.",
        "Your psychological resilience manifests in your ability to make hard decisions without being crushed by guilt, witness horrible events without becoming paralyzed, and maintain focus during crisis situations when others are falling apart. You've developed mental techniques for managing stress, fear, and isolation that keep you functional when the world seems determined to drive you insane.",
        "What others admire about you is your unshakeable determination and emotional stability. When groups are on the verge of panic or despair, your calm presence and rational thinking help stabilize the situation. You're often called upon to make the decisions that others can't handle emotionally, and your ability to bear that psychological burden makes you invaluable as a leader or advisor.",
        "Your weakness is sometimes becoming emotionally disconnected from the human cost of survival. Your focus on mental toughness can make you seem cold or unfeeling to others who are struggling with trauma. However, your psychological strength is often the foundation that allows entire communities to hold together when everything else is falling apart."

      "extendedDescription": [
        "You're living proof that sometimes survival is less about perfect preparation and more about sheer fucking determination to keep going. You might not have all the answers, the best gear, or the most refined strategies, but you have something equally valuable - an unbreakable will to live and an ability to stumble through disasters that would kill more 'qualified' survivors.",
        "Your survival has been a combination of good instincts, decent luck, and a talent for learning from your mistakes without dying in the process. You've picked up survival skills through trial and error, formed alliances based on gut feelings rather than strategic planning, and somehow managed to avoid the worst disasters through a mixture of caution and circumstance.",
        "What keeps you alive is your authenticity and relatability to other survivors. You're not intimidating or threatening, which makes people more likely to help you or accept you into their groups. Your honest reactions to the horrors of the wasteland remind others of their own humanity, and your determination to keep going despite everything inspires hope in dark times.",
        "Your challenge is building the specialized skills and knowledge that long-term survival requires. Your generalist approach and learning-as-you-go strategy works for basic survival, but may leave you vulnerable to specific threats or unable to contribute meaningfully to advanced survivor communities. However, your proof that ordinary people can survive extraordinary circumstances gives hope to everyone still fighting to stay alive."
