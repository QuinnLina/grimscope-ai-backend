      "subtitle": "Alive but empty, functioning but not feeling",
      "basic_analysis": "You survived by becoming emotionally hollow. Every feeling that could cause pain was systematically shut down until what remains is a perfectly functioning shell of a person. You adapted by subtracting pieces of yourself until you became light enough to float above the suffering. The terrible irony is that your protection is so complete, you can no longer access joy, wonder, or love either. You're the walking proof that sometimes survival costs everything that makes life worth living.",
      "detailed_analysis": [
        "Your adaptation was a masterclass in psychological surgery - you removed your capacity to feel deeply about anything because feeling meant vulnerability, and vulnerability meant potential destruction. What began as temporary emotional anesthesia became permanent amputation of your emotional life.",
        "You function beautifully in the world, meeting every expectation and completing every task with mechanical precision. But underneath the competent exterior is a vast emptiness where your inner life used to be. You've become a person-shaped absence, going through the motions of living without the animating force of genuine emotion.",
        "In relationships, you're present but unreachable, caring but unable to access the feeling of caring. People sense something missing but can't identify what. You love them in theory but can't feel the warmth of that love. It's like being colorblind in an emotional world - you know the feelings should be there, but you can't see them.",
        "Recovery requires the terrifying prospect of allowing feeling to return, knowing that pain will come with it. You've survived by becoming invulnerable, but healing demands choosing vulnerability again. The path back to wholeness means accepting that feeling everything deeply is worth the risk of being hurt again."

      "title": "The Adapted Predator",
      "subtitle": "Transformed from prey to hunter for survival",
      "basic_analysis": "You survived by becoming what once threatened you. Your adaptation was evolutionary - transforming from victim to victor, from the hunted to the hunter. You learned that in a world of predators and prey, safety lies in never being prey again. Now you move through life with calculated precision, always reading the room, always maintaining advantage. The cost is devastating: you've lost the capacity for genuine vulnerability, trust, and authentic connection with others.",
      "detailed_analysis": [
        "Your transformation was born from a fundamental realization: the world contains those who take and those who are taken from, and you decided which side you wanted to be on. You developed an almost supernatural ability to read people's weaknesses, motivations, and pressure points - not out of malice, but out of survival necessity.",
        "You've become master of a game that others don't even know they're playing. Every interaction contains elements of strategy, every relationship has calculated components of give and take. You're not necessarily cruel, but you're always aware of power dynamics and positioning yourself advantageously within them.",
        "The tragedy is that your predatory adaptations make genuine intimacy nearly impossible. You can't fully trust because you assume others are playing the same strategic game you are. You can't be vulnerable because vulnerability is weakness, and weakness is dangerous. Even your love has tactical elements that contaminate its purity.",
        "Healing requires the terrifying prospect of disarming yourself - laying down the weapons that have kept you safe for so long. Recovery means learning to risk being prey again, this time by choice, with people who have earned your trust. It means discovering that true strength can coexist with vulnerability."

      "title": "The Living Ghost",
      "subtitle": "Present in body but absent in spirit",
      "basic_analysis": "You adapted by learning to disappear - not physically, but existentially. You became so insubstantial that life flows around you rather than through you. Your survival strategy was to become too ethereal to hurt, too invisible to target, too absent to damage. You float through existence like smoke, present but not really there, visible but not truly seen. The cost is that you've become a ghost haunting your own life, watching from the outside but never fully participating.",
      "detailed_analysis": [
        "Your disappearing act was so successful that you sometimes question whether you ever really existed at all. You learned to make yourself so small, so quiet, so unremarkable that you could slip through life without drawing the attention that felt dangerous. You became a master of existing in the spaces between other people's attention.",
        "You experience life as if watching it through glass - you can see everything happening, but you can't quite touch it or be touched by it. Even positive experiences feel distant and muted. You're like a photographer who's always behind the camera, documenting life but never stepping into the frame.",
        "In relationships, people often feel like they can't quite reach you, no matter how much they care. You're present but elusive, caring but untouchable. Others may describe feeling like they're trying to hug smoke - they can see you and want to connect, but there's nothing solid to hold onto.",
        "Recovery requires the gradual, terrifying process of rematerializing - allowing yourself to become solid and substantial again. Healing means risking visibility, learning to take up space, and trusting that being seen doesn't automatically mean being hurt. It's about choosing presence over protection."

      "subtitle": "Optimized for function, deprived of soul",
      "basic_analysis": "You survived by becoming mechanical - replacing your organic, unpredictable emotional responses with calculated, reliable behavioral programs. Every spontaneous reaction was optimized out and replaced with appropriate responses. You adapted by turning yourself into a perfectly functioning system that never malfunctions, never surprises, never fails to meet expectations. The cost is that you've lost access to the beautiful chaos of human spontaneity, creativity, and authentic emotional response.",
      "detailed_analysis": [
        "Your transformation into a human machine wasn't cruel - it was efficient. You analyzed what responses worked best in different situations and programmed those responses so thoroughly that they became automatic. You optimized yourself for maximum functionality and minimum unpredictability, creating a person who never breaks down but also never truly comes alive.",
        "You've become incredibly competent, reliable, and successful by conventional measures. You always know what to say, how to act, and what response is expected. But underneath the flawless performance is someone who can't remember what it feels like to react naturally to anything. Your emotions have become data points to be processed rather than experiences to be felt.",
        "In relationships, you're perfect on paper but something indefinable is missing. You say the right things and do the right things, but it feels programmed rather than spontaneous. People may love your reliability while secretly longing for the messy, imperfect, surprising person you might be underneath all the optimization.",
        "Recovery requires the terrifying prospect of system failure - allowing glitches, spontaneous responses, and imperfect reactions back into your operating system. Healing means choosing beautiful inefficiency over sterile perfection, risking malfunction for the chance to feel genuinely human again."

    "shattered_adapter": {
      "title": "The Shattered Adapter",
      "subtitle": "Survival through strategic fragmentation",
      "basic_analysis": "You didn't develop one survival strategy - you shattered into multiple adaptive fragments, each specialized for different threats and environments. You're not one person with defenses; you're a collection of survival selves that switch depending on what's needed. One part went numb, another became predatory, one disappeared entirely, while another turned mechanical. You survived by becoming everything and nothing simultaneously, but the cost is coherence - you exist as fragments pretending to be a whole person.",
      "detailed_analysis": [
        "Your fragmentation wasn't random - it was strategic. Different parts of you learned different survival skills: the part that could disappear, the part that could manipulate, the part that could go numb, the part that could perform perfectly. You became a Swiss Army knife of survival mechanisms, with each tool specialized for specific threats.",
        "The challenge is that these fragments don't communicate well with each other, and you often don't know which one is driving at any given moment. You might feel predatory in one situation, completely empty in another, and mechanically perfect in a third - sometimes all within the same conversation.",
        "Your fragments serve you well in crisis but make consistency nearly impossible. People in your life may feel like they're relating to different people depending on the day, the stress level, or the particular trigger that's activated. You yourself may feel like an actor who's forgotten which role they're supposed to be playing.",
        "Recovery isn't about choosing one fragment and discarding the others - it's about integration. Healing means learning how all these survival selves can coexist and contribute to a more complete version of yourself. Your fragmentation, when integrated, can become a remarkable capacity for complexity and adaptation."

    "survival_cost": {
      "title": "The Cost Calculator",
      "subtitle": "Expert in measuring what was lost to gain safety",
      "basic_analysis": "You've become acutely aware of exactly what you sacrificed for survival, and the ledger is devastating. Unlike others who adapted unconsciously, you can itemize every piece of yourself that was traded for safety: spontaneity for control, vulnerability for armor, authenticity for acceptance. You're the accountant of your own losses, keeping meticulous track of what survival cost and whether it was worth the price.",
      "detailed_analysis": [
        "Your awareness of the cost makes your adaptations both more conscious and more painful. You know exactly what you've lost, which gives you a clarity that others lack but also a grief that others don't carry. You can trace the evolution of each survival mechanism and calculate its price with devastating precision.",
        "This consciousness is both a gift and a curse. You have insight into your own process that others may take years of therapy to develop, but you also carry the full weight of knowing what you've sacrificed. You live with the constant awareness of the person you might have been.",
        "Your relationships are complicated by your awareness of exactly how your adaptations affect them. You can see yourself performing, manipulating, or withdrawing, but knowing doesn't always mean you can stop. It's like being a passenger in your own life, watching yourself repeat patterns you wish you could change.",
        "Recovery for you involves leveraging your awareness into action. Since you already understand the cost, your healing journey can focus on whether you're willing to pay the price of change - risking the safety your adaptations provide for the possibility of recovering what was lost."

    "lost_innocence": {
      "title": "The Mourner of Lost Innocence",
      "subtitle": "Grieving the person you were before survival",
      "basic_analysis": "You carry a profound awareness of who you were before you learned to survive, and the loss feels like a death you can't properly mourn. Your adaptation cost you your innocence, wonder, and natural trust in the world. You remember being someone who reacted spontaneously, felt deeply, and moved through the world without calculating every step. That person feels like someone from another lifetime - someone beautiful who died to keep you alive.",
      "detailed_analysis": [
        "Your grief is complicated because you're mourning someone who was never allowed to fully mature - the person you would have become if you hadn't needed to adapt for survival. You remember fragments of that earlier self: their curiosity, their openness, their ability to be hurt and bounce back naturally.",
        "Unlike others who have forgotten who they were before, you carry the memory like a constant ache. You can see the exact moment innocence died and adaptation was born. This awareness makes you both more conscious of your loss and more motivated to recover what was taken.",
        "Your relationships are colored by this grief - you love people through the lens of what you've lost, always comparing what connection could be versus what your adapted self can manage. You may find yourself envying others their natural emotional responses while feeling simultaneously protective of them.",
        "Recovery involves not just healing your adaptations but also properly grieving who you were before. Healing means honoring that earlier self while discovering what parts of their essence can be recovered and integrated into who you're becoming now."

    "protective_numbness": {
      "title": "The Numbed Guardian",
      "subtitle": "Protected by the absence of feeling",
      "basic_analysis": "Your primary adaptation was the systematic numbing of your emotional responses. You discovered that you couldn't be hurt by what you couldn't feel, so you developed an exquisite ability to disconnect from your emotions the moment they became threatening. You live behind a wall of numbness that protects you from pain but also blocks access to joy, love, and vitality. You're safe but isolated in your emotional fortress.",
      "detailed_analysis": [
        "Your numbness isn't depression - it's a sophisticated defense system that can be activated when needed. You've learned to disconnect from feelings so completely that you can function through situations that would devastate others. But the system designed for crisis has become your default mode of operation.",
        "The protective numbness extends beyond just difficult emotions - it's like a blanket that covers everything. You can observe your life happening, including positive experiences, but from behind emotional glass. You know you should feel more about things that matter, but accessing those feelings feels impossible or dangerous.",
        "In relationships, your numbness creates a peculiar dynamic where you can care about people in theory but struggle to feel the warmth of that caring. You're present and reliable but emotionally unavailable in ways that you recognize but can't seem to change.",
        "Recovery requires the gradual thawing of your emotional life, knowing that pain will return along with everything else. Healing means learning to feel selectively rather than shutting down completely - developing the ability to be vulnerable without being helpless."

    "calculated_existence": {
      "title": "The Strategic Liver",
      "subtitle": "Every move planned, nothing left to chance",
      "basic_analysis": "You survived by turning life into a chess game where every move is calculated for maximum advantage and minimum risk. You analyze situations, predict outcomes, and choose responses based on strategic rather than emotional considerations. You've optimized for success and safety but lost the ability to live spontaneously. Your existence has become a series of calculated decisions that keep you protected but prevent you from truly living.",
      "detailed_analysis": [
        "Your strategic approach to life serves you well in many ways - you're successful, rarely surprised by outcomes, and maintain control over most situations. But the constant calculation is exhausting, and the inability to act spontaneously has drained the vitality from your experiences.",
        "Every relationship contains elements of strategy, every decision is weighed for potential consequences, every emotional response is filtered through analysis of what's safe or appropriate. You've become incredibly good at life management but terrible at life experience.",
        "The tragedy is that your calculated approach prevents the kind of authentic connection and spontaneous joy that makes life meaningful. You can plan for happiness but struggle to feel it; you can strategize intimacy but can't surrender to it.",
        "Recovery involves learning to risk the beautiful unpredictability of authentic living. Healing means gradually allowing unplanned responses, accepting less control over outcomes, and trusting that not everything needs to be calculated to be safe."

Different parts of you have different values, reactions, and ways of being in the world. You adapted by creating multiple survival selves, but now you're left with the complex task of figuring out which pieces are authentically you and how they might fit together into a whole person.",
      "detailed_analysis": [
        "Your fragmentation was protective - by not having one solid identity, you couldn't be completely destroyed by any single trauma or threat. But living as fragments means you never feel entirely real or consistent. You may feel like an actor who's forgotten their main character.",
        "Different situations activate different parts of your identity, sometimes in ways that surprise you. You might be competent and confident in one context while feeling lost and helpless in another. The lack of consistent self-experience makes you question which version is 'real.'",
        "Relationships become complicated because people never know which version of you they're going to encounter. You yourself may not know which part of you is responding in any given moment, making authentic connection difficult when you're not sure who's doing the connecting.",
        "Recovery involves the slow work of integration - not choosing one fragment over others, but learning how all these parts can coexist within one person. Healing means discovering that your complexity isn't a flaw to be fixed but a richness to be organized and honored."
