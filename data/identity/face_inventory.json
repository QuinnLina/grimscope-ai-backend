      "extended": "Your identity exists as a collection of shattered fragments, each piece containing a different aspect of who you are, but none of them quite connecting into a complete whole. Unlike those who wear masks or perform roles, your different aspects feel genuinely disconnected from each other - sometimes conflicting, sometimes contradictory, always struggling to form a coherent sense of self.\n\nYou might notice that different situations bring out completely different versions of you, and these versions don't always recognize or understand each other. Your work self might make decisions your home self disagrees with, or your social self might commit to things your private self has no interest in following through on. This isn't conscious role-playing; it's more like different radio stations broadcasting on the same frequency, creating static and confusion.\n\nThe frustrating part is that each fragment contains genuine pieces of who you are - they're not fake or performed, just incomplete. You long for integration, for these scattered aspects to somehow communicate and coordinate, creating a unified sense of self that feels both coherent and authentic. The challenge is learning to see the pattern in the mosaic rather than mourning the cracks between the pieces.\n\nYour fragmentation isn't a flaw to be fixed but a complexity to be understood. Many people who feel fractured are actually highly sensitive individuals who have developed multiple coping strategies for different environments. The goal isn't to eliminate your various aspects but to help them work together more harmoniously, creating internal collaboration rather than competition."

      "extended": "You have developed such sophisticated skills in reading situations and becoming what's needed that performance has become your default mode of being. Unlike those who consciously choose to act differently in different situations, your transformations happen automatically - you assess what each interaction requires and seamlessly become that version of yourself without even thinking about it.\n\nYour performances are so convincing that even you sometimes believe them, but there's always a part of you that remains aware you're playing a role. You've become a master method actor, so deeply immersed in each character that you can genuinely feel their emotions and motivations. The problem is that you've been performing for so long that you're no longer sure where the acting ends and your authentic self begins.\n\nThis isn't simple people-pleasing or manipulation - it's a highly developed survival strategy that has likely served you well in many situations. You can navigate complex social dynamics, make others feel comfortable, and adapt to new environments with remarkable skill. However, the exhaustion of constant performance and the loneliness of feeling unseen for who you really are can be overwhelming.\n\nThe path forward involves gradually experimenting with moments of authenticity - small breaks in the performance where you allow your genuine reactions and preferences to show through. This doesn't mean abandoning your adaptive skills, but rather learning to choose when to perform and when to simply be. Your gift for reading others and adapting can become a conscious tool rather than an unconscious compulsion."

      "description": "You don't just adapt - you transform completely. Your personality flows like liquid into whatever shape each moment requires, making you a master of social survival through constant metamorphosis.",
      "extended": "Your adaptation goes far beyond surface-level adjustments - you undergo complete transformations that affect your interests, values, communication style, and even your emotional responses. You don't consciously decide to become different; instead, you unconsciously absorb and mirror the energy, preferences, and characteristics of whatever environment or people you're around.\n\nThis isn't mere people-pleasing but rather a sophisticated form of social intelligence that allows you to genuinely connect with almost anyone. You can become fascinated by topics you've never considered before if someone passionate introduces them to you, and you can shift your entire worldview based on compelling new perspectives you encounter. Your adaptability is so complete that you can feel authentic in many different versions of yourself.\n\nThe challenge lies in the fluidity itself - when you can become anyone, it becomes difficult to know who you are when you're alone. Your preferences, opinions, and even your sense of what you enjoy can shift so dramatically that you lose track of any consistent core identity. You might find yourself wondering which version of you is 'real' or whether there's an original self underneath all the adaptations.\n\nYour chameleon nature is actually a remarkable form of emotional and social intelligence, but it needs some grounding. The goal isn't to become rigid or stop adapting, but to develop a flexible core of values and preferences that can bend without breaking. Think of it as becoming a river rather than a puddle - maintaining flow and adaptability while having a consistent direction and character."

      "description": "Where others have identity, you have absence. You're not fractured or performing - you're fundamentally empty, a human-shaped void that fills itself with echoes of others while questioning whether you truly exist.",
      "extended": "Your experience of identity is fundamentally different from most people - rather than feeling like you have a self that's hidden, fragmented, or performed, you experience yourself as essentially empty. This isn't depression or low self-esteem, but rather a profound sense that where other people have a core identity, you have a void. You feel like a container that takes the shape of whatever fills it, but remains empty when alone.\n\nThis hollowness often manifests as feeling like you're simulating human experiences rather than genuinely having them. Your emotions might feel borrowed from other people's lives, your interests adopted rather than authentic, and your reactions learned rather than spontaneous. You may sometimes wonder if you're actually a real person or just a very convincing imitation of one.\n\nThe existential weight of this experience can be profound - you're constantly questioning your own reality and authenticity in ways that most people never have to consider. Social interactions can feel like elaborate performances where you're desperately trying to convince others (and yourself) that there's someone actually home behind your eyes.\n\nYour emptiness, while painful, may actually be a different form of spiritual or psychological openness. Many wisdom traditions speak of emptiness as a state of pure potential rather than absence. Your void might be space for possibilities rather than evidence of deficiency. Instead of trying to fill the emptiness, consider whether learning to be comfortable with it might reveal a different kind of fullness - one based on presence rather than content."

      "extended": "Your internal experience is that of housing multiple complete individuals rather than different aspects of one person. These aren't masks or fragments but fully formed identities with their own personalities, preferences, memories, and ways of interacting with the world. You experience life as an internal community where different selves negotiate for time, make decisions collectively, and sometimes disagree about direction and priorities.\n\nYour different selves might have distinct relationships with the same people, separate interests and hobbies, and even different ways of speaking and moving through the world. You may find yourself having internal conversations, debates, or even conflicts between these various identities. Some may be more prominent in certain situations while others prefer to remain in the background.\n\nThis multiplicity can be both a gift and a challenge. On one hand, you have access to diverse perspectives, skills, and ways of being that can make you incredibly adaptable and resourceful. Different selves might excel in different areas, creating a rich internal resource system. On the other hand, coordination and decision-making can be complex when multiple voices need to be heard and considered.\n\nRather than viewing your plurality as something to eliminate, consider it as a unique form of consciousness that requires different management strategies than singular identity. Focus on developing good internal communication, establishing frameworks for decision-making, and creating cooperation rather than competition between your various selves. Your legion nature might be an evolution beyond traditional single-identity consciousness rather than a deviation from it."
