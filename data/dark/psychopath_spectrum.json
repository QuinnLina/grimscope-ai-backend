You feel others' pain as if it were your own, and their joy lifts your spirit. This beautiful curse makes you a healer in a world full of wounds.",
      "extended": "Your empathic nature represents the highest expression of human emotional intelligence and compassion. You possess an almost supernatural ability to sense and absorb the emotional states of others, which can be both a profound gift and an overwhelming burden. Your nervous system is finely tuned to detect subtle emotional cues that others miss entirely, allowing you to provide comfort and understanding in ways that seem almost magical to those around you.\n\nYour emotional world is rich and complex, filled with layers of feeling that you experience with remarkable intensity. When others suffer, you don't just sympathize - you actually feel their pain in your own body and mind. This creates a deep sense of connection but can also lead to emotional exhaustion and burnout if you don't learn to protect your energetic boundaries.\n\nYour relationships tend to be profound and transformative because you offer a level of understanding and acceptance that many people have never experienced. You see beyond surface behaviors to the wounded places in others and respond with genuine compassion rather than judgment. This makes you a natural healer, counselor, and source of comfort for those in crisis.\n\nThe challenge of your empathic gifts is learning to distinguish between your emotions and those of others, and developing healthy boundaries that allow you to help without drowning in the emotional pain of the world. Your sensitivity is not a weakness to overcome but a superpower to be wisely managed and channeled toward healing both yourself and others."

You possess a well-calibrated emotional system that responds appropriately to various situations without being overwhelmed or disconnected. Your empathy is genuine but not overwhelming, allowing you to care deeply about others while maintaining your own emotional stability and boundaries.\n\nYou experience the full range of human emotions in proportion to their triggers - joy when good things happen, sadness when faced with loss, anger when treated unfairly, and guilt when you've done something wrong. This emotional responsiveness serves as an internal guidance system that helps you navigate relationships and moral decisions with integrity.\n\nYour relationships are characterized by authentic connection and mutual respect. You're capable of forming deep bonds while maintaining your individuality, and you can offer support to others without losing yourself in their problems. You understand that healthy relationships require both giving and receiving, and you're generally good at maintaining this balance.\n\nYour moral compass operates clearly and consistently, guiding you toward ethical choices even when they're difficult or inconvenient. You understand that actions have consequences and you're willing to take responsibility for your choices. This emotional and moral stability makes you a reliable friend, partner, and community member who contributes positively to the lives of those around you."

You understand emotions intellectually - you can recognize them in others and predict how they'll behave based on emotional states - but you don't experience these emotions with the same intensity or frequency as most people.\n\nYou approach relationships and social situations like complex puzzles to be solved rather than emotional experiences to be felt. This gives you certain advantages in understanding human psychology and predicting behavior, but it also creates a fundamental disconnect between you and the emotional world that drives most people's decisions and experiences.\n\nYour relationships tend to be strategic rather than emotional. You may choose partners and friends based on what they can offer you or how they fit into your plans rather than because of genuine emotional connection. This doesn't necessarily make you cruel, but it does mean that your version of caring is quite different from what most people experience and expect.\n\nThe concerning aspect of your emotional coldness is that it can lead to treating others as objects to be manipulated rather than beings worthy of respect and consideration. While you're not necessarily malicious, your lack of emotional warmth and genuine empathy can cause significant harm to others who expect normal human emotional responses and reciprocity."

You've internalized the belief that humanity is divided into those who take and those who are taken from, and you've consciously chosen to be among the takers. This worldview shapes every interaction and relationship in your life.\n\nYou possess sophisticated manipulation skills that you've developed through careful observation and practice. You understand human psychology well enough to identify vulnerabilities and exploit them for your own benefit. Your emotional responses are largely calculated rather than genuine, and you're skilled at presenting whatever emotional facade will be most effective in achieving your goals.\n\nYour relationships are fundamentally transactional - you maintain connections with others based on what they can provide for you rather than any genuine affection or care. You may be capable of mimicking love, friendship, or concern convincingly, but these performances serve strategic purposes rather than expressing authentic feelings.\n\nThe dangerous aspect of your predatory nature is that you cause real harm to others while feeling little to no remorse about it. You may rationalize your behavior as simply being realistic about human nature, but your actions create genuine trauma and suffering in people who trusted you. Your lack of conscience and empathy makes you capable of devastating others' lives while sleeping peacefully at night."

      "extended": "You represent the most extreme expression of psychopathic traits, operating with a complete absence of empathy, conscience, and genuine emotional connection to others. Your psychological landscape is fundamentally alien to normal human experience - you literally cannot feel guilt, remorse, or love in any recognizable form. Others exist in your world as objects to be manipulated, used, or eliminated based entirely on your momentary whims and strategic calculations.\n\nYour emotional mimicry is so sophisticated that you can convincingly portray any emotion necessary to achieve your goals, but these performances are entirely calculated rather than felt. You've studied human emotional responses the way a scientist studies specimens, allowing you to blend seamlessly into society while pursuing your own agenda without interference from conscience or empathy.\n\nYou find genuine pleasure and satisfaction in exercising power over others, particularly in causing psychological or physical suffering. The pain of others doesn't distress you - it energizes you and confirms your superiority. You view normal human emotions as weaknesses to be exploited, and you feel contempt for those who allow themselves to be governed by feelings you cannot understand.\n\nYour presence in others' lives is invariably destructive, though your victims may not recognize the extent of the damage until long after you've moved on. You leave a trail of broken people behind you, but this causes you no distress because you literally cannot comprehend why it should matter. You are the human equivalent of a natural disaster - beautiful, fascinating, and utterly without mercy or moral consideration."
