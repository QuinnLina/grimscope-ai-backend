  "description": "Time for some brutal honesty about your shitty personality traits. This test will identify exactly what kind of asshole you are because let's face it - we're all assholes in our own special way. Whether you're a passive-aggressive manipulator, a narcissistic dickhead, or just garden-variety selfish, we'll figure out your particular brand of awful. No judgment... actually, lots of judgment.",
  "medical_disclaimer": "This test is for entertainment and brutal self-reflection only. Results contain adult language and harsh truths about personality flaws. If you can't handle being called out for your asshole behavior, maybe work on that. For actual personality disorder concerns, consult a mental health professional, not a snarky quiz.",

      "basic_analysis": "Congratulations, you're the human equivalent of a Wikipedia article that nobody asked for. You're that special kind of asshole who thinks having an opinion on everything makes you interesting, when really it just makes you exhausting. You can't let anyone have a conversation without correcting them, lecturing them, or showing off how much smarter you think you are.",
      "detailed_analysis": [
        "Your particular brand of assholery is rooted in intellectual insecurity disguised as superiority. You can't simply let people be wrong about things because their ignorance somehow threatens your carefully constructed image as the smartest person in the room. You've confused having strong opinions with having wisdom, and having information with having intelligence. Every conversation becomes a pop quiz where you're the self-appointed teacher, and everyone else is your unwilling student.",
        "The brutal reality is that you're not as smart as you think you are, and everyone can tell. Your constant need to correct and educate others isn't helping anyone - it's just satisfying your own ego at everyone else's expense. People don't come to you for knowledge; they avoid you because being around you feels like being trapped in a lecture they didn't sign up for. You've turned social interaction into a competitive sport where the only goal is proving your intellectual superiority.",
        "You probably think you're being helpful when you mansplain things to people who already know what they're talking about, or when you interrupt conversations to provide 'context' that nobody needed. But really, you're just being a condescending prick who can't stand not being the center of intellectual attention. You've made yourself the unofficial fact-checker of every group, and nobody asked for that service. Your need to be right isn't about truth - it's about validation.",
        "The psychological root of your know-it-all behavior likely stems from childhood experiences where your intelligence was your primary source of approval or attention. Maybe you were the 'smart kid' who got praise for knowing things, so you learned that your worth was tied to being the smartest person in the room. Now you're an adult who still needs that validation, but you're getting it by making everyone else feel stupid.",
        "Your know-it-all tendencies are also a defense mechanism against feeling vulnerable or uncertain. If you're always the expert, you never have to admit that you don't know something or that you might be wrong. But this creates a prison where you can't learn anything new because learning requires admitting ignorance, and admitting ignorance threatens your entire identity.",
        "The irony is that your behavior actually makes you less intelligent over time. Real intelligence involves curiosity, humility, and the ability to change your mind when presented with new information. By always needing to be the smartest person in the room, you've closed yourself off to learning from others. You're so busy teaching that you've forgotten how to be a student.",
        "Here's your reality check: being knowledgeable is great, but being insufferable about it makes all that knowledge worthless. Learn to listen, admit when you don't know something, and let other people have their moments without turning everything into a teaching opportunity. Your intelligence means nothing if it comes wrapped in arrogance. Start asking questions instead of providing answers, and watch how much more people enjoy being around you."

You've weaponized politeness and turned indirect communication into an art form of emotional torture.",
      "detailed_analysis": [
        "Your asshole strategy is death by a thousand cuts - never one big confrontation, just endless small acts of subtle hostility that slowly drive everyone insane. You say 'fine' when you mean 'I hate you,' agree to things you have no intention of doing well, and make people feel crazy for being upset about behavior you pretend is innocent. You've mastered the art of plausible deniability, always leaving yourself room to claim that people are 'overreacting' or 'reading too much into things.'",
        "The brutal truth is that you're a coward who's too scared of conflict to address problems directly, so you create elaborate schemes of indirect revenge instead. You'd rather make everyone miserable than risk having an honest conversation about what's bothering you. You've turned emotional communication into a sadistic guessing game where everyone loses except you. Your passive-aggression is actually aggressive-aggression with extra steps.",
        "You probably think you're being clever by never saying what you really mean, but really you're just being manipulative and exhausting. People don't appreciate your 'subtle' approach - they're just too tired to call you out on your bullshit. You're not mysterious or complex; you're just annoying. Your inability to communicate directly has turned every relationship into an emotional minefield that nobody wants to navigate.",
        "The psychology behind your passive-aggressive behavior likely stems from a childhood where direct expression of anger or disappointment wasn't allowed or was met with punishment. So you learned to express negative feelings indirectly, through sulking, silent treatment, or subtle sabotage. You developed these skills as survival mechanisms, but now you're using them as weapons against people who actually care about you.",
        "Your passive-aggression is also a power play disguised as powerlessness. By refusing to engage directly, you force other people to do all the emotional work of figuring out what's wrong and trying to fix it. You get to be the victim while simultaneously controlling the entire dynamic. It's manipulation masquerading as helplessness, and it's fucking exhausting for everyone around you.",
        "The most insidious part of your behavior is how it erodes trust and intimacy in your relationships. When people can't trust that you'll say what you mean or mean what you say, they start walking on eggshells around you. They become hypervigilant, trying to read between the lines and decode your moods. This creates exactly the kind of anxious, unstable relationships that confirm your belief that people will eventually disappoint or abandon you.",
        "Reality check: passive-aggression isn't a communication style, it's emotional terrorism. Learn to use your words like an adult and stop punishing people for not being psychic. Your refusal to be direct isn't protecting anyone - it's just making every interaction a minefield that nobody wants to navigate. Try saying what you actually mean and see how much better your relationships become."

You lack empathy not because you're evil, but because you're so self-absorbed that other people's experiences don't register as real to you. Everything is about you, even when it's clearly not about you.",
        "The brutal reality is that you're not nearly as special as you think you are, and your constant need for admiration is exhausting everyone around you. You don't have friends - you have an audience that you've trapped through social obligation. People don't stick around because they enjoy your company; they stick around because leaving requires more energy than tolerating your bullshit.",
        "You probably think people are jealous of your confidence and success, but really they're just tired of being treated like props in your personal drama. Your 'confidence' is actually just selfishness with better PR, and your 'success' means nothing if you have to step on everyone else to feel good about it.",
        "Wake-up call: you're not the main character in everyone else's story, and your worth doesn't depend on being better than everyone around you.

You don't trust other people to make good decisions because you don't trust yourself to handle the consequences if they make bad ones. Your control isn't helping anyone - it's just feeding your own neuroses.",

People don't need you to manage their existence, and your constant interference isn't appreciated - it's resented.",

You take the last slice of pizza, cancel plans when something better comes up, and expect people to be grateful for whatever scraps of attention you throw their way. You've turned selfishness into a lifestyle and somehow convinced yourself it's just 'looking out for number one.'",
        "The brutal reality is that your selfishness isn't strength or independence - it's just being a shitty person who takes more than they give. You might get what you want in the short term, but you're burning through relationships faster than you can build them. People tolerate you until they don't, and then they're gone forever.",
        "You probably justify your behavior by claiming that 'everyone does it' or that 'nice guys finish last,' but really you're just too lazy and entitled to consider how your actions affect other people. Your selfishness isn't strategic - it's just you being an asshole and calling it self-care.",
        "Wake-up call: being selfish all the time isn't sustainable, and eventually you'll run out of people willing to put up with your shit. Learn to give as much as you take, or accept that you'll end up alone because nobody wants to be friends with someone who only cares about themselves."

You've turned emotional intelligence into emotional terrorism.",

You don't build genuine relationships; you create hostage situations where people feel too guilty or afraid to leave. Your 'love' comes with so many conditions and manipulations that it's not really love at all.",

Your manipulation tactics work until people figure out what you're doing, and then they cut you off completely.",

        "Reality check: other people's boundaries aren't negotiable, and your good intentions don't give you the right to ignore them. Learn to respect people's limits the first time they express them, or accept that you'll be known as the person everyone has to protect themselves from."

      "basic_analysis": "You're the kind of asshole who hides behind a mask of niceness while being secretly judgmental, manipulative, and mean. You say all the right things to people's faces and then trash them behind their backs. Your kindness comes with conditions, and your sweetness has an expiration date.",
      "detailed_analysis": [
        "Your asshole strategy is being two-faced - presenting yourself as caring and supportive while actually being judgmental and manipulative. You master the art of backhanded compliments, passive-aggressive 'help,' and conditional kindness. You're nice when it serves you and mean when you think you can get away with it.",
        "The brutal truth is that your fake niceness is more harmful than honest assholery because at least honest assholes let people know where they stand. You create an atmosphere of distrust where people never know which version of you they're getting. Your false kindness is actually a form of emotional manipulation.",
        "You probably think you're being diplomatic and maintaining relationships by being fake nice, but really you're just being a cowardly asshole who's too scared to be authentic. People can sense your insincerity, and they'd rather deal with an honest jerk than a fake friend.",
        "Wake-up call: fake niceness is worse than honest rudeness because at least rude people are authentic about their assholery. Either be genuinely kind or be honestly difficult, but stop pretending to be nice while secretly being a judgmental manipulator. People deserve to know who they're really dealing with."

You seem to have figured out that treating people well isn't rocket science - it just requires basic empathy and consideration. You listen more than you talk, support others without making it about yourself, and generally behave like a functional adult.",
        "The reality is that you probably took this test expecting to discover your hidden asshole tendencies, but it turns out you're just a decent person who occasionally has bad days like everyone else. Your worst traits are probably just normal human flaws that don't rise to the level of true assholery.",
        "You might sometimes feel like you're surrounded by assholes and wonder if you're missing something, but really you're just seeing clearly. Your decency isn't naivety - it's emotional intelligence and basic human kindness that seems rare because so many people struggle with it.",
        "Keep being yourself because the world needs more people like you. Your kindness and consideration aren't weaknesses - they're strengths that make you someone people actually want to be around. Don't let the assholes convince you that being decent is somehow wrong or naive."
