We're talking about your drinking, your shopping, your emotional eating, your social media addiction, and all those other 'harmless' habits that are slowly destroying your life. Buckle up, buttercup.",

If you're struggling with addiction, mental health issues, or harmful coping mechanisms, please seek professional help. Seriously, a snarky quiz can't replace actual therapy or medical treatment.",

Your coping mechanism is basically 'better living through chemistry,' and spoiler alert: it's not working. You're not solving problems - you're just adding chemical dependency to your growing list of issues while pretending that numbness equals healing.",
      "detailed_analysis": [
        "Your damage is that you've outsourced your emotional regulation to substances because feeling feelings is apparently too fucking hard. Whether it's alcohol, weed, pills, or whatever else you're putting in your body, you've convinced yourself that chemical solutions are the answer to psychological problems. Plot twist: they're not. You've essentially hired drugs to do the job that your brain is supposed to do naturally, and now your brain has gotten lazy and forgotten how to cope without pharmaceutical assistance.",
        "The brutal reality is that every time you reach for a substance instead of dealing with your emotions, you're choosing temporary relief over permanent healing. You're not coping - you're postponing. Every drink, every pill, every hit is just kicking the can down the road, and eventually you're going to run out of road. You're treating symptoms instead of causes, like taking painkillers for a broken leg instead of setting the bone.",
        "You probably tell yourself you 'have it under control' and that you're 'not like those other people' with addiction problems. But here's the thing - if your first response to stress is to alter your consciousness, you're already in problematic territory. You've made substances your emotional support system, which is like using a flamethrower to light a candle. Sure, it works, but it's wildly inappropriate and potentially destructive.",
        "The psychology behind your substance use is likely rooted in an inability to tolerate emotional discomfort. Maybe you never learned healthy coping skills as a child, or maybe you learned that feelings are dangerous and should be avoided at all costs. Either way, you've developed a relationship with substances that's more reliable than any relationship you have with actual humans. Your drugs don't judge you, disappoint you, or leave you - they just reliably make the bad feelings go away.",
        "What you don't realize is that emotions serve a purpose - they're information about your internal state and your environment. When you numb them with substances, you're essentially blindfolding yourself while trying to navigate life. You can't make good decisions when you can't feel the consequences of bad ones. You can't build healthy relationships when you're chemically unavailable for genuine connection.",
        "Your substance use is also robbing you of the opportunity to develop actual resilience. Every time you reach for a chemical solution instead of working through a problem, you're confirming to yourself that you can't handle life without help. You're creating a self-fulfilling prophecy where you become increasingly dependent on external substances because you never practice internal coping skills.",
        "The hard truth: your substances aren't helping you cope - they're preventing you from learning how to cope. Every time you numb out instead of working through, you're keeping yourself emotionally stunted. You need actual coping skills, not better drugs. Get professional help before your 'solution' becomes a bigger problem than what you were trying to escape. You're stronger than you think, but you'll never know it if you keep outsourcing your emotional regulation to chemicals."

Your relationship with food is so fucked up that you're literally consuming your problems instead of solving them.",
      "detailed_analysis": [

Food has become your drug of choice, your comfort, your punishment, and your reward all rolled into one dysfunctional package. You eat when you're sad, mad, glad, or just existing, because apparently your mouth is the only way emotions can escape your body.",
        "The brutal reality is that you're not actually hungry - you're empty. But no amount of food is going to fill the void inside you because emotional hunger isn't solved by physical consumption. You're trying to eat your way out of feelings, which is like trying to drink the ocean - impossible and ultimately destructive.",
        "You probably have a complicated relationship with shame around food, alternating between 'fuck it' binges and self-hatred spirals. You use food to punish yourself for having feelings, then feel guilty about eating, then eat more to deal with the guilt. It's a perfect storm of dysfunction disguised as a coping mechanism.",
        "Reality check: food is fuel, not therapy. You need to learn to sit with your emotions instead of swallowing them. Every time you eat your feelings, you're choosing temporary fullness over permanent healing. Get therapy, learn actual emotional regulation skills, and stop using your digestive system as an emotional processing unit."

Every emotional crisis gets solved with a shopping spree, every bad day gets 'fixed' with a purchase, and every feeling gets buried under a pile of shit you don't need with money you don't have. You're literally buying into the lie that external things can fix internal problems.",
        "The brutal truth is that you're not shopping - you're self-medicating with capitalism. Every 'add to cart' click is you trying to purchase an identity, buy self-worth, or shop your way out of depression. But here's the kicker: you can't buy happiness, and your Amazon cart isn't a therapy session.",

You've turned consumption into your primary coping mechanism, which is basically trying to heal emotional wounds with material band-aids.",
        "Wake-up call: no amount of stuff is going to make you feel like enough. Every purchase that promises to fix your life is lying to you. You need to learn to sit with emptiness instead of filling it with things. Get financial counseling, address your underlying emotional issues, and stop treating Target like your therapist's office."

You're basically paying for the privilege of feeling inadequate, except the currency is your mental health and self-esteem.",

You spend hours consuming other people's lives instead of living your own, seeking validation from strangers while ignoring the actual relationships in front of you. You've made your phone your emotional support device, which is like trying to get hugs from a brick.",

You hurt yourself to feel in control, to punish yourself, to feel something other than emptiness, or to express pain you can't verbalize. But here's the brutal truth - you're not solving anything, you're just creating more problems while avoiding the real work of healing.",
        "The reality is that self-harm is a symptom of much deeper issues that need professional attention. You're trying to use physical pain to regulate emotional pain, which is like trying to fix a computer by hitting it with a hammer. It might provide temporary relief, but it's ultimately destructive and doesn't address the underlying issues.",
        "You probably feel ashamed about it while simultaneously feeling like it's the only thing that helps. You might hide it, lie about it, or minimize it, but the urge to hurt yourself when you're overwhelmed isn't normal and it's not sustainable. You deserve better than turning your body into a punching bag for your emotions.",

Every time life gets overwhelming, you disappear like you're in witness protection, cutting off the very connections that could help you heal. You've made loneliness your comfort zone, which is like trying to cure depression by avoiding joy.",
        "The brutal truth is that you're not protecting yourself by hiding - you're punishing yourself with isolation. Humans are social creatures, and you're essentially putting yourself in emotional solitary confinement every time you get stressed. You're starving yourself of connection while wondering why you feel empty.",
        "You probably tell yourself that people are the problem and that you're better off alone, but really you're just scared of being vulnerable or rejected. You've made isolation your default because it feels safer than risking being hurt, but safety without connection isn't living - it's just existing.",
        "Reality check: you can't heal in isolation from the very relationships you need for healing.

        "You probably justify your behavior as 'living life' or 'being adventurous,' but there's a difference between healthy risk-taking and emotional self-medication through danger. You're using adrenaline to avoid processing emotions, which is like trying to solve depression by bungee jumping.",
        "Wake-up call: you can't outrun your problems by literally running toward death. The high you get from risky behavior is just another form of avoidance, and eventually your luck will run out.

You've made work your escape from life, but life is still waiting for you when you finally stop running. You're building a career on the foundation of emotional avoidance.",

      "detailed_analysis": [
        "Your damage is that you've confused ignoring problems with solving them. You live in a carefully constructed reality where anything unpleasant is either someone else's fault, not that serious, or simply non-existent. You've made denial your full-time job, and reality is your biggest enemy.",
        "The brutal truth is that problems don't disappear because you refuse to acknowledge them - they just grow bigger in the dark. Every issue you pretend doesn't exist is still affecting your life, your relationships, and your future. You're not protecting yourself with denial; you're just postponing the inevitable reckoning.",
        "You probably get angry when people try to point out reality to you because maintaining your delusions requires constant vigilance against truth. You've surrounded yourself with people who enable your denial or you've isolated yourself from anyone who might challenge your fantasy version of events.",
        "Wake-up call: reality always wins in the end. The longer you avoid dealing with problems, the bigger and more complicated they become. You can't live in a fantasy forever, and when reality finally forces its way in, it's going to hurt more than if you'd dealt with it honestly from the beginning."

      "basic_analysis": "Holy shit, you're actually doing this whole 'coping with life' thing correctly. Your mechanisms for dealing with stress and problems are... healthy? Revolutionary. You process emotions instead of numbing them, seek support instead of isolation, and handle problems instead of avoiding them. In today's world of toxic coping, you're basically a unicorn.",
      "detailed_analysis": [
        "Your 'damage' is that you're surprisingly well-adjusted in a world full of people using shopping carts as therapists and social media as antidepressants. You've somehow figured out that feeling feelings doesn't kill you, that problems are meant to be solved rather than avoided, and that asking for help is strength, not weakness.",
        "The reality is that you probably still struggle sometimes - everyone does - but you've developed actual coping skills instead of elaborate avoidance strategies. You use healthy outlets like exercise, therapy, creative pursuits, or genuine social connection to process difficult emotions. You're living proof that functional coping mechanisms exist.",
        "You might sometimes feel like you're the only adult in a world of emotional toddlers, which can be isolating. Your healthy approach to problems might make others uncomfortable because it highlights their own dysfunction. Don't let other people's chaos convince you to abandon your healthy habits.",
        "Keep doing what you're doing because you've cracked the code that most people spend decades trying to figure out. Your coping mechanisms actually cope instead of creating more problems. You're not perfect, but you're functional, which in today's world makes you basically a superhero."
