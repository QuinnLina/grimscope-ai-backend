You analyze every emoji, read into every delayed response, and have turned emotional labor into an Olympic sport. Your anxiety has anxiety, and you've made it everyone else's problem.\n\nThe real kicker? You know you're doing it but can't stop. You're like a moth to a flame, except the flame is human connection and you keep getting burned because you fly too close too fast. Your relationships are a series of panic spirals disguised as love stories.\n\nHere's the brutal truth: your anxious attachment isn't cute or quirky - it's exhausting. For you AND everyone around you. People can feel your desperation from space, and nothing kills attraction faster than someone who treats every text delay like a personal apocalypse.\n\nBut here's the thing - this damage is fixable with actual work. Therapy isn't a suggestion, it's a necessity. Learn to self-soothe instead of using other people as emotional regulation devices. Your future relationships will thank you for doing the work instead of making them your unpaid therapists."

You care so much it terrifies you, so you've perfected the art of caring from a safe distance. Every relationship comes with an exit strategy because you've convinced yourself that leaving first means you win.\n\nYour damage manifests as emotional allergies - genuine intimacy makes you break out in hives. You're the master of surface-level connections and shallow conversations that never threaten your carefully constructed fortress of solitude. Deep down, you're just scared of being known because being known means being potentially rejected.\n\nThe brutal reality is that your avoidance isn't protecting you - it's limiting you. You're so busy preventing potential pain that you're missing out on actual joy. Your relationships have the emotional depth of a puddle because you refuse to let anyone see the ocean underneath.\n\nHere's your wake-up call: vulnerability isn't weakness, it's courage. And your current strategy of emotional hit-and-run isn't sustainable. Either learn to let people in or accept that you'll die alone with your pristine boundaries and perfect independence. Your choice."

You've mastered the art of functional misery - showing up, doing the bare minimum, and making self-deprecating jokes to deflect from the fact that you're falling apart.\n\nThe scary part? You've accepted this as normal. You think everyone feels this empty and everyone else is just better at pretending. But here's the thing - most people don't spend their days fighting the urge to disappear, and most people don't need to convince themselves that life is worth living on a daily basis.\n\nYour dark humor isn't helping you heal - it's helping you avoid healing. Every joke about wanting to die is a way to express your pain without actually dealing with it. You've become a performance artist of your own suffering, and the show must go on because stopping means facing the silence.\n\nReality check: this isn't sustainable, and it's not as invisible as you think. People can see you drowning even when you're smiling. The question is whether you're going to keep treading water or actually swim to shore. Professional help isn't giving up - it's fighting back."

Your nervous system is stuck in fight-or-flight, interpreting normal relationship friction as existential threats.

It's your identity, your excuse, and your comfort zone all rolled into one. You wear your trauma like armor, but it's actually a prison. Every new relationship becomes a reenactment of old wounds because familiar pain feels safer than unfamiliar healing.\n\nYou overshare your trauma like it's currency, trauma-dumping on anyone who shows the slightest interest. But here's the kicker - awareness doesn't equal healing. Knowing why you're fucked up doesn't magically unfuck you. You need to do the actual work, not just catalog your damage like it's an interesting hobby.\n\nPlot twist: you're not as broken as you think you are. You're just comfortable being broken because it requires less vulnerability than being whole. Healing means giving up the story that keeps you safe, and that's terrifying.

You've convinced yourself that your chaos makes you interesting, that your unpredictability makes you unique. But here's the brutal truth: you're not mysterious, you're exhausting. People aren't intrigued by your emotional volatility - they're walking on eggshells.\n\nYou sabotage good things because they feel foreign, choosing familiar dysfunction over unfamiliar stability. Your relationships are crash courses in emotional whiplash, and you wonder why people eventually tap out.

Your inner critic has taken up permanent residence in your head, providing a running commentary of everything you're doing wrong.

Every day you wake up and decide to believe the worst about yourself despite evidence to the contrary. You've become so comfortable with self-hatred that self-love feels fake. You'd rather be right about being worthless than risk being wrong about being valuable.\n\nYou seek external validation to fill an internal void, but it's like pouring water into a bucket with holes in the bottom.

You've built your entire identity around being special, superior, and significant, but it's all constructed on quicksand. Any threat to your carefully curated image sends you into a narcissistic rage that you disguise as justified anger.\n\nYou don't really love people - you love how they make you feel about yourself. Your relationships are transactional: you provide charm and charisma, they provide validation and worship. When they stop playing their role in your one-person show, you discard them like broken toys.\n\nWake-up call: you're not as special as you think you are, and that's actually liberating. Your worth doesn't depend on being superior to everyone else. The energy you spend maintaining your false self could be used to develop your actual self.

Your trauma has become your brand, your excuse, and your way of controlling conversations. You mistake intensity for intimacy and crisis for connection, creating drama to feel seen and heard.\n\nYou've turned your pain into performance art, but the show is getting old.

Your endless need for rescue is exhausting everyone around you.\n\nReality check: your trauma is real, but your attachment to it is a choice.

Your comedy is just tragedy with better timing, and you've become a performance artist of your own pain.\n\nThe brutal truth is that your dark humor isn't helping you heal - it's helping you avoid healing. Every joke about your trauma is a way to acknowledge it without processing it. You've turned your coping mechanism into your personality, and now you don't know who you are without the punchlines.\n\nPeople appreciate your humor until they realize it's a wall. You deflect every genuine moment, turn every sincere conversation into a comedy show, and wonder why your relationships feel shallow. Your humor connects you to people, but it also keeps them at arm's length.\n\nReality check: you can be funny without being self-destructive and entertaining without being tragic. Your worth isn't dependent on your ability to make light of dark situations. Sometimes the bravest thing you can do is not make a joke. Time to let people see the person behind the punchlines."

      "description": "You're convinced you've fooled everyone and they're about to catch on. Every success feels like luck, every compliment feels like a lie, and you're waiting for someone to expose you as the fraud you believe you are.",
      "extended": "You can't internalize achievements but you internalize every failure. Your brain has a Teflon coating for praise and Velcro for criticism. You've convinced yourself that everyone else knows something you don't, that there's some manual for life that you never received.\n\nThe real damage isn't your lack of confidence - it's how much energy you waste on self-doubt. You spend more time worrying about being exposed than actually developing skills. You've turned competence into performance anxiety and achievement into evidence of your deception.\n\nYou seek reassurance constantly but dismiss it immediately because clearly they just don't know you well enough yet. You've made it impossible to succeed in your own mind, creating standards so high that meeting them feels fraudulent and missing them confirms your worthlessness.\n\nReality check: if you were really faking it, you wouldn't be this worried about being caught. Actual frauds don't lie awake at night consumed by guilt about their deception. Your impostor syndrome is proof of your integrity, not evidence of your inadequacy. Time to give yourself credit where credit is due."
