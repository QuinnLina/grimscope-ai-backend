News flash: dry shampoo isn't a personality trait, and deodorant isn't a suggestion. Your bathroom probably looks like a crime scene, and your sheets have achieved sentience from neglect.\n\nThe brutal truth? You're single because people can smell you from across the room. Your dating profile might be perfect, but reality hits like a brick wall wrapped in unwashed laundry. You're not quirky or authentic - you're just gross. And before you blame society's 'unrealistic standards,' remember that basic cleanliness has been attractive since literally the dawn of civilization.\n\nYou probably think you're 'too busy' for proper hygiene or that it's 'not important' compared to your sparkling personality. But here's the thing - nobody gets to experience your amazing personality because they're too distracted by wondering when you last saw soap. Your crusty exterior is blocking access to whatever gem might be hiding underneath.\n\nThe fix is embarrassingly simple: shower daily, brush your teeth, wear clean clothes, and change your damn sheets. You're not a lost cause, just a dirty one. Invest in basic hygiene products instead of more dating apps. Your future relationships will thank you for discovering the magic of regular bathing."

Every conversation becomes about you, every disagreement becomes a war, and every minor inconvenience becomes someone else's fault. You've turned being difficult into an art form and wonder why people don't appreciate your 'honesty' (which is just cruelty with better PR).\n\nYou probably think you're just being 'authentic' or 'speaking your truth,' but your truth is that you're insufferable. You've confused having standards with being impossible to please, and having opinions with being argumentative. Your dates don't end badly because people can't handle your amazingness - they end badly because people can't handle your toxicity.\n\nThe hard pill to swallow: your personality is the problem, not everyone else's inability to appreciate you. Learn empathy, practice kindness, and stop treating every interaction like a competition you need to win. Therapy isn't a suggestion - it's a necessity for anyone who has to deal with you."

      "title": "Emotional Hit-and-Run Specialist", 
      "description": "You're single because the moment things get real, you vanish like you're in witness protection. You want connection but panic at the first sign of actual intimacy. You've perfected the art of getting close enough to hurt people when you inevitably run away.",
      "extended": "Your damage is that you're terrified of vulnerability, so you sabotage anything good before it can hurt you. You're like a human flight response - always ready to bolt when things get too comfortable. You ghost people like it's your full-time job, leaving a trail of confused and hurt potential partners wondering what they did wrong.\n\nThe brutal truth is that you're not protecting yourself - you're just guaranteeing you'll die alone. Every time you run away from something real, you're choosing fear over happiness. You've convinced yourself that independence is better than interdependence, but really you're just scared of being known and potentially rejected.\n\nYou probably have a mental catalog of excuses: 'They were moving too fast,' 'I'm not ready,' 'The timing isn't right.' But here's the reality - you're never going to be ready because ready requires risk, and you've decided risk isn't worth it. You'd rather be lonely than vulnerable, which is the saddest trade-off in human history.\n\nYour commitment phobia isn't serving you anymore. It's keeping you from the very thing you claim to want. Time to either get therapy to address whatever trauma made you this way, or accept that you're choosing to be alone. But stop pretending you want a relationship when what you really want is the fantasy of connection without the reality of commitment."

      "description": "You're single because you're looking for a unicorn in a world full of horses. Your standards aren't high - they're delusional. You've created an impossible fantasy of what a partner should be and wonder why reality keeps disappointing you.",
      "extended": "Your damage is that you've confused having standards with having delusions. You want someone who's perfect in every way while bringing nothing equivalent to the table yourself. You're probably average in most ways but expect to date someone who's exceptional in every way. The math doesn't add up, but you keep playing the lottery.\n\nThe brutal reality is that your 'dream person' doesn't exist, and if they did, they wouldn't want you. You've been brainwashed by rom-coms and social media into thinking you deserve a fairy tale without putting in fairy tale effort. You're waiting for someone to complete you instead of completing yourself first.\n\nYou probably swipe left on perfectly good people because they don't meet your ridiculous checklist. Height requirements, salary minimums, specific hobbies, perfect teeth - you've turned dating into a job interview for a position that doesn't exist. Meanwhile, you're offering the personality equivalent of a participation trophy.\n\nReality check: lower your standards or raise your own value. Either become the amazing person you expect to attract, or accept that good enough is actually pretty great. Stop holding out for perfect and start appreciating good. Your standards aren't protecting you from settling - they're protecting you from happiness."

      "extended": "Your damage is that you're more comfortable with failure than success, so you create failure even when success is handed to you. You probably have a great person interested in you right now, but you're finding reasons why it won't work. You're addicted to your own dysfunction and allergic to your own happiness.\n\nThe brutal truth is that you don't think you deserve love, so you make sure you don't get it. Every relationship becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy of doom because you'd rather be right about being unlovable than wrong about deserving happiness. You've weaponized your insecurities against your own best interests.\n\nYou probably create problems where none exist, pick fights over nothing, and find fault with perfectly good people. You're like a relationship arsonist - building something beautiful just so you can burn it down. Your pattern is probably so predictable that your friends have started a betting pool on when you'll ruin the next good thing.\n\nThe hard truth: you're going to keep sabotaging relationships until you deal with whatever made you believe you don't deserve love. Get therapy, do the work, and stop making your trauma everyone else's problem. You can't have healthy relationships with an unhealthy relationship with yourself."

    "social_disaster": {
      "title": "Walking Social Catastrophe",
      "description": "You're single because you have the social skills of a feral cat. Every interaction is a masterclass in making people uncomfortable. You don't read social cues - you bulldoze right through them like they're made of tissue paper.",
      "extended": "Your damage is that you're socially tone-deaf to the point where people need subtitles to understand what you're trying to communicate. You overshare, under-listen, and somehow always manage to say exactly the wrong thing at exactly the wrong time. Your dating life is like watching a car crash in slow motion.\n\nThe brutal reality is that dating is fundamentally a social activity, and you're socially incompetent. You probably think you're being 'authentic' when you're actually being inappropriate. You mistake honesty for tactlessness and depth for oversharing. People don't avoid you because they can't handle your realness - they avoid you because you're exhausting.\n\nYou likely dominate conversations, miss obvious hints, and make people feel like they're being interviewed by an alien who's never observed human behavior. Your idea of flirting is probably explaining cryptocurrency for an hour or detailing your food allergies before ordering appetizers.\n\nThe fix requires acknowledging that social skills are actual skills that can be learned. Practice reading the room, listening more than you speak, and understanding that not every thought needs to be voiced. Your authenticity is great, but it needs to come with a side of basic social awareness."

      "extended": "Your damage is that you've weaponized your pain and made it everyone else's responsibility to fix you. You don't want a partner - you want a free therapist who also provides physical intimacy. Every interaction becomes about your problems, your drama, your needs. You're like an emotional black hole that sucks the joy out of every room.\n\nThe brutal truth is that nobody wants to date someone whose primary personality trait is their unresolved trauma. You've confused depth with drama and intimacy with intensity. You think sharing your deepest wounds on the first date is vulnerability, but it's actually just inappropriate and manipulative.\n\nYou probably start conversations with 'You'll never believe what happened to me today' and end them with someone else's life force completely drained. You've made your mental health everyone else's problem while taking zero responsibility for actually getting better. You collect sympathy like it's a currency and spend it like you're rich.\n\nReality check: people want to date someone who adds to their life, not someone who makes their life harder. Get actual professional help for your issues instead of making random dates your unpaid emotional labor force. Your trauma is real, but it's not a personality and it's not anyone else's job to heal you."

      "extended": "Your damage is that you have no damage - which somehow is damage in itself. You're so aggressively normal that you've circled back to being abnormal. You probably think 'stable' is a personality trait and 'reliable' counts as being interesting. Your dating profile probably mentions loving long walks on the beach and your favorite food being pizza.\n\nThe brutal reality is that you're forgettable. People don't dislike you - they just don't remember you exist. Your conversations are like elevator music for the soul: background noise that nobody actively chooses to engage with. You're not bad enough to be interesting or good enough to be memorable.\n\nYou probably think you're a 'nice person' and can't understand why that's not enough. But nice isn't a personality - it's the bare minimum for human interaction. You need actual interests, opinions, passions, or at least a hobby that doesn't involve Netflix and complaining about how dating apps suck.\n\nThe fix is developing an actual personality. Find something you're passionate about, have opinions about things, take some risks, be willing to be disliked for who you are rather than tolerated for who you're pretending to be. Bland is not a strategy for love - it's a strategy for being everyone's backup plan."

      "extended": "Your damage is that you've turned toxicity into an art form. You probably think you're just 'passionate' or 'intense,' but really you're just abusive with good marketing. You manipulate, guilt-trip, jealous-rage, and control like it's your job. Your relationships aren't partnerships - they're hostage situations with dinner dates.\n\nThe brutal truth is that you're not misunderstood - you're correctly understood as someone to avoid. You probably have a trail of exes who are still in therapy because of you. You create drama because chaos feels like passion, and you mistake fear for respect. You're not a catch - you're a cautionary tale.\n\nYou likely blame all your failed relationships on other people being 'too sensitive' or 'unable to handle you.' But the common denominator in all your failed relationships is you. You're not a victim of circumstance - you're a creator of toxicity who refuses to take responsibility for the emotional damage you cause.\n\nThe hard pill to swallow: you need intensive therapy and a complete personality overhaul. Stop dating until you can have a relationship with yourself that doesn't involve emotional abuse. You're not ready for love until you learn how to love without destroying. Get help before you hurt someone else."

      "extended": "Your damage is that your desperation is like a toxic cologne that overwhelms everyone around you. You probably plan your wedding after the second date and name your future children before you've had the first fight. Your neediness isn't cute - it's suffocating. People can smell desperation, and yours reeks.\n\nThe brutal reality is that desperation repels the very thing you're desperate for. You're so hungry for love that you're willing to accept scraps and call it a feast. You probably say 'I love you' too early, text too frequently, and make every interaction feel like a job interview for the position of 'person who completes me.'\n\nYou likely ignore red flags because you're just grateful someone is paying attention to you. You've confused intensity with intimacy and neediness with love. Your relationships move at the speed of desperation, which is way too fast for anyone with healthy boundaries.\n\nReality check: learn to be complete on your own before trying to complete someone else's life. Desperation isn't attractive - confidence is. Work on yourself, develop your own life, and stop treating every potential partner like they're your salvation. Love yourself first, or nobody else will want to."

      "extended": "Your damage is that you've turned every relationship into a reenactment of your childhood trauma. You either cling desperately or push people away, sometimes in the same conversation. You test people constantly to see if they'll leave, then act surprised when they actually do. You're like a relationship stress-test that nobody signed up for.\n\nThe brutal truth is that you're exhausting to love. Your attachment issues mean that every normal relationship milestone feels like a threat, every minor disagreement feels like abandonment, and every gesture of love feels like a setup for betrayal. You've made being with you feel like walking through an emotional minefield.\n\nYou probably analyze every text, question every motive, and turn every relationship into a psychological thriller where you're both the detective and the suspect. You want security but create chaos, demand loyalty but question everything, need love but don't believe you deserve it.\n\nThe fix requires serious therapy to address whatever childhood wounds are still bleeding all over your adult relationships. Stop making your attachment issues everyone else's problem and start taking responsibility for healing yourself. You can't have healthy relationships with unhealthy attachment patterns."

      "extended": "Your 'damage' is that you're refreshingly normal in a world full of emotional chaos. You have your shit together, communicate like an adult, and treat people with basic human decency. In today's dating landscape, this makes you about as rare as a unicorn riding a dragon while filing their taxes on time.\n\nThe reality is that being single doesn't mean you're broken - it means you have standards and aren't willing to compromise them for the sake of having a warm body next to you. You'd rather be alone than in bad company, which is actually a sign of emotional maturity, not damage.\n\nYou probably encounter a lot of the other personality types from this test and wonder what the hell is wrong with people. The answer is: a lot. But don't let the dating wasteland convince you to lower your standards or settle for dysfunction. Your standards aren't the problem - the dating pool is just contaminated.\n\nKeep being your awesome self and don't let the dating apocalypse change you. The right person will appreciate your emotional stability, hygiene habits, and ability to communicate without creating drama. You're not single because you're broken - you're single because you're selective, and that's actually beautiful."
