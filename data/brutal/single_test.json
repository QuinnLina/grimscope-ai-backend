  "description": "Time for some brutal honesty about your dating life. This test will reveal exactly why you're still swiping instead of settling down. We're talking about everything - your hygiene, your personality, your dating habits, and those lovely little quirks that send potential partners running. Fair warning: this might sting worse than your last breakup.",
  "medical_disclaimer": "This test is for entertainment and brutal self-reflection only. Results contain adult language and harsh dating truths. If you can't handle honest feedback about why you're perpetually single, maybe stick to horoscopes. For actual relationship advice, talk to a therapist, not a snarky quiz.",

It's because they're still recovering from the first one.",
      "detailed_analysis": [
        "Your damage is literally visible and sometimes audible. You've convinced yourself that 'natural musk' is attractive and that basic hygiene is optional. News flash: dry shampoo isn't a personality trait, and deodorant isn't a suggestion. Your bathroom probably looks like a crime scene, and your sheets have achieved sentience from neglect.",
        "The brutal truth? You're single because people can smell you from across the room. Your dating profile might be perfect, but reality hits like a brick wall wrapped in unwashed laundry. You're not quirky or authentic - you're just gross. And before you blame society's 'unrealistic standards,' remember that basic cleanliness has been attractive since literally the dawn of civilization.",
        "You probably think you're 'too busy' for proper hygiene or that it's 'not important' compared to your sparkling personality. But here's the thing - nobody gets to experience your amazing personality because they're too distracted by wondering when you last saw soap. Your crusty exterior is blocking access to whatever gem might be hiding underneath.",
        "The fix is embarrassingly simple: shower daily, brush your teeth, wear clean clothes, and change your damn sheets. You're not a lost cause, just a dirty one. Invest in basic hygiene products instead of more dating apps. Your future relationships will thank you for discovering the magic of regular bathing."

You might look good on paper and even better in person, but spending time with you is like emotional Russian roulette. You're judgmental, critical, self-centered, and probably think these are positive traits that show you have 'high standards.'",
        "The brutal reality is that you're exhausting to be around. Every conversation becomes about you, every disagreement becomes a war, and every minor inconvenience becomes someone else's fault. You've turned being difficult into an art form and wonder why people don't appreciate your 'honesty' (which is just cruelty with better PR).",
        "You probably think you're just being 'authentic' or 'speaking your truth,' but your truth is that you're insufferable. You've confused having standards with being impossible to please, and having opinions with being argumentative. Your dates don't end badly because people can't handle your amazingness - they end badly because people can't handle your toxicity.",
        "The hard pill to swallow: your personality is the problem, not everyone else's inability to appreciate you. Learn empathy, practice kindness, and stop treating every interaction like a competition you need to win. Therapy isn't a suggestion - it's a necessity for anyone who has to deal with you."

You're like a human flight response - always ready to bolt when things get too comfortable. You ghost people like it's your full-time job, leaving a trail of confused and hurt potential partners wondering what they did wrong.",

You've convinced yourself that independence is better than interdependence, but really you're just scared of being known and potentially rejected.",
        "You probably have a mental catalog of excuses: 'They were moving too fast,' 'I'm not ready,' 'The timing isn't right.' But here's the reality - you're never going to be ready because ready requires risk, and you've decided risk isn't worth it. You'd rather be lonely than vulnerable, which is the saddest trade-off in human history.",
        "Your commitment phobia isn't serving you anymore. It's keeping you from the very thing you claim to want. Time to either get therapy to address whatever trauma made you this way, or accept that you're choosing to be alone.

You're probably average in most ways but expect to date someone who's exceptional in every way. The math doesn't add up, but you keep playing the lottery.",
        "The brutal reality is that your 'dream person' doesn't exist, and if they did, they wouldn't want you. You've been brainwashed by rom-coms and social media into thinking you deserve a fairy tale without putting in fairy tale effort. You're waiting for someone to complete you instead of completing yourself first.",

Height requirements, salary minimums, specific hobbies, perfect teeth - you've turned dating into a job interview for a position that doesn't exist. Meanwhile, you're offering the personality equivalent of a participation trophy.",

Every relationship becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy of doom because you'd rather be right about being unlovable than wrong about deserving happiness. You've weaponized your insecurities against your own best interests.",

You're like a relationship arsonist - building something beautiful just so you can burn it down. Your pattern is probably so predictable that your friends have started a betting pool on when you'll ruin the next good thing.",

You mistake honesty for tactlessness and depth for oversharing. People don't avoid you because they can't handle your realness - they avoid you because you're exhausting.",
        "You likely dominate conversations, miss obvious hints, and make people feel like they're being interviewed by an alien who's never observed human behavior. Your idea of flirting is probably explaining cryptocurrency for an hour or detailing your food allergies before ordering appetizers.",

You're like an emotional black hole that sucks the joy out of every room.",

You think sharing your deepest wounds on the first date is vulnerability, but it's actually just inappropriate and manipulative.",
        "You probably start conversations with 'You'll never believe what happened to me today' and end them with someone else's life force completely drained. You've made your mental health everyone else's problem while taking zero responsibility for actually getting better. You collect sympathy like it's a currency and spend it like you're rich.",

Your dating profile probably mentions loving long walks on the beach and your favorite food being pizza.",

        "You probably think you're a 'nice person' and can't understand why that's not enough. But nice isn't a personality - it's the bare minimum for human interaction. You need actual interests, opinions, passions, or at least a hobby that doesn't involve Netflix and complaining about how dating apps suck.",
        "The fix is developing an actual personality. Find something you're passionate about, have opinions about things, take some risks, be willing to be disliked for who you are rather than tolerated for who you're pretending to be.

You create drama because chaos feels like passion, and you mistake fear for respect. You're not a catch - you're a cautionary tale.",
        "You likely blame all your failed relationships on other people being 'too sensitive' or 'unable to handle you.' But the common denominator in all your failed relationships is you. You're not a victim of circumstance - you're a creator of toxicity who refuses to take responsibility for the emotional damage you cause.",
        "The hard pill to swallow: you need intensive therapy and a complete personality overhaul. Stop dating until you can have a relationship with yourself that doesn't involve emotional abuse.

People can smell desperation, and yours reeks.",

You probably say 'I love you' too early, text too frequently, and make every interaction feel like a job interview for the position of 'person who completes me.'",
