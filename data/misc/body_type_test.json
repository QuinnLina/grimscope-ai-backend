Your body is like a high-performance engine that burns fuel rapidly and excels at endurance activities. While building muscle mass requires dedicated effort and strategic nutrition, your natural leanness and metabolic efficiency are valuable assets that become increasingly advantageous with age.",

        "Your ectomorphic body type represents the epitome of metabolic efficiency and natural leanness. With your small to medium bone structure, narrow frame, and fast-twitch nervous system, you're naturally built for activities requiring speed, agility, and endurance over pure strength. Your body composition tends to remain lean effortlessly, with minimal fat storage even when your diet isn't perfect. This genetic gift means you rarely struggle with weight gain, though building substantial muscle mass requires more strategic effort than other body types.",
        "Nutritionally, your rapid metabolism demands a high-calorie approach with frequent meals to maintain energy and support any muscle-building goals. Your body burns through carbohydrates efficiently, making them your primary fuel source rather than your enemy. Focus on calorie-dense whole foods, with protein intake of 1-1.2g per pound of body weight distributed throughout the day. Healthy fats should comprise 25-30% of your calories to support hormone production and provide sustained energy.",
        "Your training approach should emphasize building and preserving muscle mass while leveraging your natural endurance capabilities. Heavy compound movements with progressive overload will help you build the muscle mass that doesn't come naturally. Limit excessive cardio during muscle-building phases, as your already-fast metabolism can work against mass gains. However, moderate cardiovascular exercise will enhance your impressive natural endurance.",
        "Long-term success for your body type involves embracing your natural strengths while strategically addressing your challenges. Your lean genetics become increasingly valuable as you age and others struggle with metabolic slowdown. Focus on building functional strength and maintaining bone density through resistance training throughout your life. Your challenge isn't weight management - it's ensuring adequate nutrition to support your active metabolism and building enough muscle mass to maintain strength and metabolic health as you age."
