      "basic_analysis": "You have the classic ectomorph body type with a naturally lean physique, fast metabolism, and small bone structure. Your body is like a high-performance engine that burns fuel rapidly and excels at endurance activities. While building muscle mass requires dedicated effort and strategic nutrition, your natural leanness and metabolic efficiency are valuable assets that become increasingly advantageous with age.",
      "detailed_analysis": [
        "Your ectomorphic body type represents the epitome of metabolic efficiency and natural leanness. With your small to medium bone structure, narrow frame, and fast-twitch nervous system, you're naturally built for activities requiring speed, agility, and endurance over pure strength. Your body composition tends to remain lean effortlessly, with minimal fat storage even when your diet isn't perfect. This genetic gift means you rarely struggle with weight gain, though building substantial muscle mass requires more strategic effort than other body types.",
        "Nutritionally, your rapid metabolism demands a high-calorie approach with frequent meals to maintain energy and support any muscle-building goals. Your body burns through carbohydrates efficiently, making them your primary fuel source rather than your enemy. Focus on calorie-dense whole foods, with protein intake of 1-1.2g per pound of body weight distributed throughout the day. Healthy fats should comprise 25-30% of your calories to support hormone production and provide sustained energy. Don't fear carbohydrates - your body uses them immediately for energy rather than storing them as fat.",
        "Your training approach should emphasize building and preserving muscle mass while leveraging your natural endurance capabilities. Heavy compound movements with progressive overload will help you build the muscle mass that doesn't come naturally. Limit excessive cardio during muscle-building phases, as your already-fast metabolism can work against mass gains. However, moderate cardiovascular exercise will enhance your impressive natural endurance. Recovery is crucial - your highly active nervous system needs adequate rest between intense sessions, typically 48-72 hours between training the same muscle groups.",
        "Long-term success for your body type involves embracing your natural strengths while strategically addressing your challenges. Your lean genetics become increasingly valuable as you age and others struggle with metabolic slowdown. Focus on building functional strength and maintaining bone density through resistance training throughout your life. Your challenge isn't weight management - it's ensuring adequate nutrition to support your active metabolism and building enough muscle mass to maintain strength and metabolic health as you age. Consider this a genetic advantage that requires smart management rather than a limitation."

With your naturally balanced proportions, moderate bone structure, and efficient metabolism, you have the foundation for excellence in virtually any physical pursuit. Your body composition responds predictably to training and nutrition changes, allowing you to build muscle during gaining phases and lose fat during cutting phases with relative ease compared to other body types.",
        "Your nutritional approach should emphasize balance and consistency rather than extremes. A moderate caloric intake with balanced macronutrients serves you well: 25-30% protein, 40-45% carbohydrates, and 25-30% healthy fats. Your metabolism is neither too fast nor too slow, giving you flexibility in your diet while still requiring consistency for optimal results. You respond well to nutrient timing - eating larger meals around workouts and moderate portions throughout the day. Your body efficiently uses both carbohydrates and fats for fuel, making you adaptable to various dietary approaches.",
        "Training-wise, you're gifted with the ability to respond well to almost any exercise protocol, which is both an advantage and a potential pitfall. You can build muscle with strength training, improve cardiovascular fitness with endurance work, and excel in sports requiring power, agility, or coordination. Your challenge is often choosing focus rather than trying to excel at everything simultaneously. Periodization works exceptionally well for your body type - alternating between strength-focused phases, endurance phases, and body composition phases throughout the year.",

As you age, your favorable genetics help you maintain muscle mass and metabolic health better than other body types, but consistency becomes increasingly important.

With your larger bone structure, broader shoulders and hips, and natural muscular development, you possess inherent advantages in activities requiring force production and mass. Your slower metabolism means your body is exceptionally efficient at storing energy, which can lead to fat gain if not managed but also provides excellent fuel reserves for intense training sessions. You typically have the genetic potential to build more muscle mass than other body types.",
        "Nutritionally, your efficient metabolism requires more careful management of caloric intake and macronutrient composition. You respond exceptionally well to lower carbohydrate approaches, particularly those emphasizing protein and healthy fats. Portion control is crucial, as your body readily converts excess calories to fat storage. However, your muscle-building capacity is excellent, so adequate protein intake (1.2-1.5g per pound of body weight) is essential. Consider carb cycling or timing carbohydrates around workouts to maximize their benefits while minimizing fat storage.",
        "Your training should emphasize your natural strengths while addressing metabolic challenges. Heavy resistance training with compound movements builds upon your natural strength and muscle-building capacity. Regular cardiovascular exercise is essential for metabolic health and fat management - both steady-state cardio and high-intensity intervals can be beneficial. Your body responds well to structure and consistency, so establishing regular training routines and progression schemes yields the best results. Recovery between sessions may take longer than other body types.",

With proper nutrition and training, you can maintain excellent muscle mass and functional strength throughout life. Your challenge is managing body fat levels, but your advantage is the ability to build and maintain more muscle mass than other body types, providing metabolic benefits and functional strength that becomes increasingly valuable with age.

This combination often produces the coveted 'fitness model' physique - lean, defined, and athletic without excessive bulk. Your metabolism runs efficiently while still allowing for muscle development with proper training and nutrition.",
        "Nutritionally, you need to balance the higher caloric needs of your ectomorphic tendencies with strategic nutrient timing typical of mesomorphic training. You require adequate calories to fuel your active metabolism and support muscle growth, but you have more dietary flexibility than pure ectomorphs. Focus on nutrient timing around workouts - higher carbohydrates pre and post-training with steady protein throughout the day. Your lean nature allows for more dietary variety while maintaining excellent body composition with reasonable consistency.",
        "Your training approach can successfully pursue both muscle building and endurance goals simultaneously more effectively than other body types. Include both strength training for muscle development and cardiovascular work for endurance - your body adapts well to varied training stimuli. Progressive overload in resistance training will build quality muscle, while your natural endurance capabilities allow for extensive cardiovascular training without significant muscle loss. Recovery needs are moderate - typically 24-48 hours between training the same muscle groups.",

You have the genetic foundation to maintain an impressive physique throughout life while excelling in endurance and strength activities. Your challenge is choosing focus when needed - while you can do both strength and endurance well, periodizing your training toward specific goals will yield the best results.
