      "description": "You're the modern foodie who values both speed and quality. Your restaurant personality combines efficiency with innovation, delivering maximum flavor impact in minimum time.",
      "extended": "Your Fast Casual Fusion personality reflects someone who has mastered the art of living efficiently without sacrificing quality. In restaurants, you gravitate toward places that have streamlined their operations but haven't compromised on flavor innovation. You're the person who discovers the amazing Korean-Mexican fusion joint before it becomes trendy, not because you're trying to be cool, but because you recognize good systems and creative execution.\n\nYour approach to food mirrors your approach to life: strategic, well-researched, but flexible enough to adapt when you discover something better. You're not afraid to try new cuisines or flavor combinations, but you want them to make sense. Random weirdness for its own sake doesn't appeal to you - you prefer innovation that serves a purpose and enhances the experience rather than just grabbing attention.\n\nIn social settings, you're often the one who finds the perfect restaurant for group dining - somewhere that can accommodate different dietary preferences, serves food quickly enough that people don't get hangry, but interesting enough that everyone leaves talking about the meal. You understand that food is both fuel and experience, and you've learned to optimize for both without sacrificing either.\n\nYour ideal kitchen runs like a well-oiled machine but still has room for creativity and experimentation. You meal prep efficiently but aren't afraid to improvise when inspiration strikes. You're the friend people trust for restaurant recommendations because you've somehow found places that are both reliable and exciting - a combination that seems impossible but that you've made your specialty."

      "description": "You're the embodiment of hospitality and warmth in restaurant form. Your personality creates spaces where people feel genuinely cared for and welcomed.",
      "extended": "Your Cozy Comfort Cafe personality makes you a natural nurturer who understands that food is love made edible. You're drawn to restaurants that feel like someone's grandmother's kitchen - places where the staff remembers your order, asks about your day, and makes you feel like family. You prefer establishments that have been perfecting the same recipes for decades over places chasing the latest trends, because you understand that comfort comes from consistency and familiarity.\n\nYour approach to cooking and entertaining focuses on creating emotional experiences rather than culinary stunts. You're the person who brings homemade cookies to new neighbors, who hosts dinner parties where everyone leaves feeling more connected than when they arrived, and who can turn a simple meal into a memory that people carry with them. Your kitchen is the heart of your home, and your table is where relationships are built and maintained.\n\nIn relationships, you're the friend people call when they need comfort, the family member who always remembers everyone's favorite foods, and the colleague who brings homemade soup when someone's sick. You understand intuitively that feeding people is one of the most fundamental ways to show love and care, and you use food as a language of affection and support.\n\nYour ideal restaurant would be the kind of place where regulars have 'their table,' where special occasions are celebrated with personalized touches, and where the measure of success isn't profit margins but the number of genuine smiles and satisfied sighs from contentment. You believe that the best meals happen when people feel safe, welcomed, and cared for - everything else is just seasoning on top of that foundation."

      "extended": "Your Upscale Fine Dining personality reflects someone who has developed sophisticated palate and appreciates the craftsmanship that goes into exceptional cuisine. You're not a food snob - you're a food connoisseur who understands the difference between expensive and valuable, between complicated and complex. You seek out restaurants where chefs are artists, where every element of the meal has been carefully considered, and where the entire experience transports you beyond simple sustenance into something approaching art.\n\nYour approach to food and dining is informed by a deep appreciation for skill, tradition, and innovation working in harmony. You understand wine pairings, seasonal ingredients, and cooking techniques not to show off, but because these things genuinely enhance your enjoyment of the meal. You're willing to wait for a reservation at the restaurant you really want rather than settling for whatever's available, because you know the difference is worth it.\n\nIn social situations, you're often the person who elevates the occasion. You know which restaurants are worth the splurge for special celebrations, you can navigate a wine list with confidence, and you understand how to appreciate and discuss food in ways that enhance rather than intimidate the dining experience. You share your knowledge generously but never condescendingly, helping others develop their own appreciation for culinary excellence.\n\nYour ideal restaurant would be a place where every detail has been perfected, where the service is intuitive but never intrusive, where the menu represents the chef's vision and skill, and where each visit feels like a special occasion even if it's just Tuesday night. You understand that true luxury isn't about ostentation - it's about quality executed so flawlessly that it seems effortless."

      "extended": "Your Quirky Experimental personality makes you the culinary equivalent of an explorer, always seeking new territories of taste and texture. You're genuinely excited by menus that confuse other people, intrigued by ingredients you can't pronounce, and delighted by flavor combinations that sound terrible on paper but create magic in your mouth. You understand that innovation requires risk, and you're willing to occasionally have a terrible meal in exchange for sometimes having a transcendent one.\n\nYour approach to food reflects a broader philosophy of embracing novelty and challenging assumptions. You're the person who orders the most unusual item on the menu, who seeks out food trucks serving fusion cuisines that don't traditionally exist, and who travels specifically to try regional specialties that sound bizarre to outsiders. You're not being contrarian - you're genuinely curious about the full spectrum of human culinary creativity.\n\nIn social settings, you're the friend who introduces others to new experiences, who suggests restaurants that others might never have considered, and who can make even the most adventurous eaters feel conservative by comparison. You have stories about amazing meals in unexpected places and terrible meals that were worth it for the experience alone. You understand that food is culture, and you want to experience as many cultures as possible through their cuisine.\n\nYour ideal restaurant would be constantly changing, where the menu is an ongoing experiment, where traditional techniques meet unexpected ingredients, and where the chef views each dish as a hypothesis to be tested rather than a formula to be followed. You want to be surprised, challenged, and occasionally confused by your food, because you understand that comfort zones are where interesting flavors go to die."

      "description": "You embody the heart and soul of classic dining - where recipes are passed down through generations and every meal feels like coming home.",
      "extended": "Your Traditional Family Restaurant personality represents the backbone of comfort dining - you understand that some things are classic because they're perfect as they are. You're drawn to restaurants where the recipes haven't changed in decades, where portions are generous and prices are fair, and where the focus is on feeding people well rather than impressing them. You appreciate the skill required to execute simple dishes perfectly, understanding that there's nowhere to hide when you're making meatloaf or fried chicken.\n\nYour approach to food is rooted in the understanding that meals are about more than nutrition - they're about connection, tradition, and care. You're the person who knows the stories behind family recipes, who can turn basic ingredients into something that tastes like love, and who understands that the secret ingredient in great comfort food is often simply taking the time to do things right. You value the ritual of shared meals and the way food can anchor families and communities.\n\nIn social situations, you're often the one who suggests places that feel like home, who knows which diners serve the best pie, and who can find the perfect spot for a multi-generational family dinner where everyone from toddlers to grandparents will be happy. You understand that some of the most meaningful food experiences happen in humble settings, and you have a gift for recognizing authenticity and quality regardless of how fancy the surroundings are.\n\nYour ideal restaurant would be the kind of place where three generations of the same family have been serving the same beloved recipes, where regulars are treated like family, where the portions are generous and the prices are fair, and where the measure of success is how many people leave feeling satisfied, cared for, and eager to return. You believe that good food doesn't need to be complicated - it just needs to be made with care and served with love."

      "description": "You represent the perfect marriage of health and flavor, proving that nutritious food can be absolutely delicious.",
      "extended": "Your Health-Conscious Bistro personality reflects a sophisticated understanding of nutrition that goes beyond mere calorie counting or trend-following. You're drawn to restaurants that source ingredients responsibly, that understand the connection between farming practices and flavor, and that can make vegetables as exciting as any protein. You appreciate chefs who view cooking as a form of medicine, understanding that what we eat directly impacts how we feel and function.\n\nYour approach to food is holistic - you consider not just how something tastes, but how it will make you feel an hour later, where the ingredients came from, and what impact your food choices have on the environment and community. You're not rigid or judgmental about food, but you've developed a palate that genuinely craves fresh, clean flavors and feels satisfied by meals that provide real nourishment rather than empty calories.\n\nIn social settings, you're often the person who discovers amazing restaurants that happen to be healthy, who can find delicious options that accommodate various dietary restrictions, and who proves to skeptical friends that 'health food' doesn't have to mean sacrificing flavor. You have a gift for making nutritious choices feel indulgent rather than restrictive, and you understand how to balance enjoying food with feeling good about what you're eating.\n\nYour ideal restaurant would showcase the incredible variety and flavor possible when working with fresh, seasonal, locally-sourced ingredients. It would be a place where the chef's skill lies in highlighting natural flavors rather than masking them, where sustainability is a priority without being preachy about it, and where every meal demonstrates that taking care of your body can be one of life's greatest pleasures rather than a burden or sacrifice."

      "description": "You're the fearless flavor warrior who believes that food should wake up your taste buds and make your heart race.",
      "extended": "Your Spicy Bold Kitchen personality reflects someone who approaches food - and life - with courage and intensity. You're drawn to cuisines that aren't afraid to make a statement: authentic Sichuan restaurants where the numbing heat builds slowly, Mexican joints that serve salsa so fresh and fiery it makes you sweat, Thai places that don't tone down the spice for Western palates. You understand that heat isn't just about capsaicin - it's about the complex interplay of spices that create depth, warmth, and excitement in every bite.\n\nYour appreciation for bold flavors extends beyond just heat - you love foods that make strong impressions, whether that's the funk of fermented foods, the brightness of acidic dishes, or the richness of deeply savory umami bombs. You're the person who orders the dish with the chili pepper warnings next to it, who seeks out hole-in-the-wall places known for their authentic spice levels, and who has built up a tolerance that lets you appreciate subtleties in heat that others miss entirely.\n\nIn social settings, you're often the one who introduces friends to new levels of spice, who knows which restaurants will challenge your palate without destroying it, and who can guide others through building their heat tolerance gradually. You understand that sharing spicy food creates a unique bonding experience - there's something about collectively surviving a particularly fiery dish that brings people together in memorable ways.\n\nYour ideal restaurant would be unapologetically bold, where the chef isn't afraid to push boundaries and challenge diners, where the spice levels are clearly marked but not dumbed down, and where heat is used as a tool to enhance and complicate flavors rather than simply overwhelm them. You want to leave feeling like you've been on an adventure, with your endorphins flowing and stories to tell about the incredible meal you just survived and savored."

      "extended": "Your Sweet Dessert Parlor personality reflects someone who hasn't lost touch with the simple joy of treating yourself to something wonderful. You're drawn to places that take dessert seriously as an art form - bakeries where every cake is a masterpiece, ice cream shops that make their own unique flavors, dessert bars where molecular gastronomy meets childhood nostalgia. You understand that great desserts require technical skill, creativity, and an understanding of how flavors, textures, and temperatures work together to create magic.\n\nYour approach to sweets is both sophisticated and playful. You can appreciate the precision required to create perfect macarons while also getting genuinely excited about a really good funnel cake. You understand the emotional power of dessert - how the right sweet can comfort, celebrate, or simply add a moment of brightness to an ordinary day. You're not mindlessly indulgent; you're selectively hedonistic, choosing quality over quantity and savoring experiences over mindless consumption.\n\nIn social settings, you're often the one who suggests ending a meal somewhere special for dessert, who knows which bakeries make the best birthday cakes, and who can turn any gathering into a celebration with the right sweet treat. You understand that sharing dessert creates intimacy and joy, and you have a gift for finding sweets that surprise and delight even the most sophisticated palates.\n\nYour ideal restaurant would be a place where dessert isn't an afterthought but the main event, where every creation is both beautiful and delicious, where traditional techniques meet creative innovation, and where every bite reminds you that life is meant to include moments of pure, uncomplicated pleasure. You believe that a world without really good dessert would be a significantly sadder place, and you're committed to ensuring that never happens."

You're drawn to establishments that understand the importance of ambiance - places with lighting that flatters everyone, acoustics that allow for intimate conversation, and service that anticipates needs without intruding on the flow of interaction.\n\nYour appreciation for wine goes beyond simple consumption - you understand how the right pairing can elevate both food and conversation, how sharing a special bottle creates intimacy and occasion, and how wine can serve as both social lubricant and topic of discussion. You're knowledgeable but not pretentious, able to navigate complex wine lists while also helping others discover new favorites without intimidating them.\n\nIn social settings, you're often the one who creates the perfect evening - you know how to choose restaurants that facilitate conversation rather than distract from it, how to order wine that complements both the food and the mood, and how to pace a meal so that it becomes an experience rather than just sustenance. You understand that the best meals happen when the food and drink serve to enhance the company rather than compete with it.\n\nYour ideal restaurant would be a place where every element - from the furniture to the music to the lighting - has been chosen to create the perfect environment for connection and conversation.

      "extended": "Your Chaotic Food Truck personality reflects someone who finds excitement in unpredictability and beauty in improvisation. You're drawn to establishments that feel alive with creative energy - food trucks where the chef is making up recipes on the fly, pop-up restaurants that exist for one night only, places where the staff is clearly making it up as they go along but somehow producing incredible food. You understand that some of the best culinary experiences come from inspired improvisation rather than careful planning.\n\nYour approach to food mirrors your approach to life - you're willing to embrace uncertainty in exchange for the possibility of discovering something amazing. You're the person who's excited by daily specials that depend on what the chef found at the market that morning, who loves restaurants where the same dish might taste different every time you order it, and who finds the energy of a chaotic kitchen more appealing than the sterile precision of fine dining.\n\nIn social settings, you're often the one who suggests the most adventurous option, who's willing to wait in long lines for food trucks with legendary reputations, and who can find amazing food in the most unlikely places. You have stories about incredible meals that happened by accident, dishes that were probably mistakes but turned out to be genius, and restaurants that exist in a state of constant beautiful chaos.\n\nYour ideal restaurant would be the kind of place where no two visits are exactly the same, where the chef's mood and inspiration drive the menu more than careful planning, where the staff's enthusiasm makes up for any organizational shortcomings, and where the food is so good that you're willing to accept a certain amount of chaos as part of the authentic experience. You believe that some of life's best moments come from embracing the unexpected, and you want your dining experiences to reflect that philosophy."

You appreciate the alchemy that transforms simple ingredients into something that nourishes both body and soul.\n\nYour approach to food values process as much as product. You understand that great bread can't be rushed, that the best croissants require days of preparation, and that there's a meditative quality to working with your hands to create something beautiful and nourishing. You're the person who can taste the difference between mass-produced and artisanal, who understands why sourdough starter is like a living pet, and who believes that supporting traditional food crafts is important for preserving culture.\n\nIn social settings, you're often the one who brings the most thoughtful contributions - bread you've baked yourself, pastries from that little place no one else knows about, or treats that represent real craftsmanship rather than convenience. You understand that sharing handmade food creates a different kind of connection than anything store-bought, and you have stories about the bakers, farmers, and food artisans who make your favorite treats possible.\n\nYour ideal restaurant would be a place where tradition and innovation work hand in hand, where ancient techniques are honored but not imprisoned by rigid rules, where you can watch skilled hands at work, and where every item on display represents hours of careful work and generations of accumulated knowledge.

You understand that small plates create big conversations and that the best meals are collaborative experiences.\n\nIn social settings, you're often the cultural translator, helping others navigate unfamiliar flavors and explaining the stories behind fusion combinations. You have an intuitive understanding of how different flavor profiles work together, and you're excited by chefs who can take risks and blend traditions in ways that honor both while creating something entirely new. You believe that food can break down barriers and create understanding between different communities.\n\nYour ideal restaurant would be a place where the menu reads like a passport, where each dish tells a story of cultural exchange and creativity, where traditional techniques from different cultures are combined with respect and skill, and where every meal feels like a celebration of our interconnected world.
