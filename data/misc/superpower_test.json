      "extended": "Your soul yearns for teleportation because you value efficiency, freedom, and the ability to transcend physical limitations. You're someone who gets frustrated by delays, barriers, and feeling trapped in difficult situations. Teleportation represents your desire for ultimate control over your environment and the freedom to help others without being constrained by distance or time.\n\nYou likely think strategically and value being able to respond quickly to emergencies or opportunities. The idea of helping others by instantly transporting them to safety or bringing resources where they're needed appeals to your practical problem-solving nature. You see obstacles as temporary inconveniences that can be bypassed rather than problems that must be worked through.\n\nYour choice reveals someone who prioritizes results over process and believes that the most direct path to a solution is usually the best one. You probably have little patience for bureaucracy, long procedures, or situations where you feel powerless to act immediately. Teleportation would give you the ultimate agency - the ability to be exactly where you need to be, when you need to be there.\n\nThis power also speaks to your deep connections with others and your desire to be helpful. You may feel burdened by your current inability to help everyone who needs it, and teleportation would remove the barriers that limit your ability to make a difference. However, your preference might also indicate a tendency toward avoiding difficult conversations or challenging situations by simply removing yourself from them."

      "extended": "Your attraction to super speed reveals someone who feels constantly pressed for time and frustrated by the pace of the world around you. You're likely highly productive, ambitious, and always thinking about efficiency. Your mind probably races ahead to solutions and next steps while your body is stuck dealing with the mundane pace of reality.\n\nSuper speed appeals to you because it would finally allow you to match your internal pace with your external capabilities. You probably find yourself thinking 'if only I could move faster' or 'there's not enough time in the day' regularly. This power would let you learn new skills instantly, help more people, accomplish your goals, and still have time for everything important to you.\n\nYour preference reveals someone who jumps into action immediately when problems arise. You're not one to overthink or hesitate when someone needs help or when a situation demands immediate response. This reflects an admirable bias toward action and a strong sense of responsibility for others. You believe that speed is often the difference between success and failure.\n\nHowever, your desire for super speed might also indicate underlying anxiety about productivity and time. You may put enormous pressure on yourself to accomplish everything and be everywhere for everyone. This can lead to burnout and a feeling that you're never doing enough. The fantasy of super speed might represent a desire to finally feel caught up with your own expectations rather than constantly falling behind."

You're likely highly empathetic and intuitive already, but you want to take that understanding to the next level. You spend significant mental energy trying to read between the lines and understand the motivations behind people's actions.\n\nMind reading appeals to you because it would eliminate guesswork in relationships and help you respond to people's real needs rather than what they claim to want. You probably find yourself constantly wondering 'what are they really thinking?' and believe that most problems stem from misunderstandings that could be avoided with perfect communication.\n\nYour choice reveals someone who wants to use this power ethically - to help people, solve problems, and create better outcomes for everyone involved. This indicates strong moral reasoning and a genuine desire to make the world better through understanding. You likely believe that most conflicts arise from miscommunication and that perfect information would lead to perfect solutions.\n\nHowever, the desire for mind reading might also reveal some trust issues or fear of being deceived. You may have been hurt in the past by people who said one thing but meant another, or you might struggle with feeling like you never really know where you stand with others. The fantasy of telepathy could represent a desire for emotional security through perfect information about others' true intentions."

You're likely introverted or highly sensitive to others' opinions and reactions. You experience being 'seen' as both a need and a burden - you want to be understood and accepted, but you also feel exhausted by the constant performance that social interaction seems to require.\n\nInvisibility appeals to you because it would allow you to help people without recognition, escape uncomfortable situations gracefully, and observe the world as it really is when people think no one is watching. You probably feel burdened by social expectations and would love the relief of being able to move through life without constant performance pressure.\n\nYour choice suggests someone who prefers to help from behind the scenes and values genuine impact over recognition. This indicates humility and pure motivation to make things better without needing credit. You may be someone who does a lot of unnoticed emotional labor or support work in your relationships and would appreciate the ability to help even more effectively.\n\nHowever, the strong appeal of invisibility might also indicate some avoidance patterns or fear of authentic visibility. You may have learned that it's safer to hide parts of yourself rather than risk rejection or criticism. While this is understandable, it can also prevent you from forming the deep connections you likely crave and from receiving the support and appreciation you deserve."

      "extended": "Your desire for super strength reveals someone who has felt powerless in important situations and never wants to experience that helplessness again. You're likely protective of others and frustrated when you can't solve problems through sheer determination and effort. You may have experienced situations where you felt unable to help someone important to you, or where you yourself felt powerless against circumstances beyond your control.\n\nSuper strength represents the fantasy of never being in that vulnerable position again - of always having enough power to change outcomes through direct action. You probably value honesty, directness, and taking action over talking about problems. This power would allow you to protect everyone you care about and ensure that you never have to stand by helplessly while bad things happen.\n\nYour preference reveals someone who confronts problems head-on rather than finding workarounds or compromises. This reflects confidence, courage, and a belief that most obstacles are just barriers waiting to be broken down. You're likely someone others turn to in crisis situations because you project competence and determination even when facing seemingly impossible challenges.\n\nHowever, the strong appeal of super strength might also indicate some discomfort with subtlety, patience, or situations that can't be solved through force. You may sometimes try to power through problems that actually require finesse, time, or emotional intelligence to resolve. The fantasy of unlimited physical power could represent frustration with the limitations of what pure effort and determination can accomplish in complex situations."

      "extended": "Your attraction to time control reveals someone who struggles with regret, perfectionism, and the irreversible nature of mistakes. You're likely detail-oriented and think carefully about consequences, but you also carry the weight of past decisions heavily. You probably replay scenarios in your mind, thinking about how things could have gone differently, and you're frustrated by the inability to fix past mistakes or prevent future problems you can see coming.\n\nTime manipulation appeals to you because it would allow you to optimize outcomes, prevent suffering, and ensure that everything happens exactly as it should. You likely experience intense frustration with the linear nature of time and the way that single moments or decisions can have lasting consequences that can't be undone. This suggests someone who thinks deeply about cause and effect.\n\nYour choice reveals someone who wants to use this power altruistically - to prevent accidents, save relationships, and optimize outcomes for others as well as yourself. This indicates strong empathy and a genuine desire to reduce suffering in the world. You may feel burdened by your ability to see potential problems coming but your inability to prevent them with current human limitations.\n\nHowever, the strong appeal of time control might also indicate difficulty accepting imperfection, uncertainty, and the natural consequences of actions. You may spend excessive mental energy on regret and 'what if' scenarios, or feel paralyzed by the fear of making irreversible mistakes. The fantasy of time manipulation could represent an attempt to escape the anxiety that comes with accepting that life is inherently unpredictable."

      "description": "You dream of ultimate freedom - the power to soar above limitations, see the bigger picture, and never feel trapped again. The sky is your escape route from earthbound problems.",
      "extended": "Your desire for flight speaks to deep psychological needs around freedom, perspective, and transcendence of limitations. You likely experience the world as full of artificial constraints that prevent you from living as freely as you'd like. Flight represents the ultimate liberation from these earthbound limitations and the ability to move through life on your own terms.\n\nYou probably value independence highly and may feel claustrophobic in overly structured or restrictive environments. You have a strong need for autonomy and may struggle with situations where you feel controlled or limited by others' rules or expectations. The ability to fly would give you the ultimate autonomy - no one could trap you or force you to stay somewhere you don't want to be.\n\nThe appeal of flight also suggests someone who values perspective and naturally thinks in terms of 'big picture' rather than getting caught up in immediate details. You probably believe that many problems would be easier to solve if people could just step back and see the larger context, and flight would literally give you that elevated viewpoint.\n\nYour choice reveals someone who craves adventure and hates feeling stuck in routine or conventional paths. You're drawn to the idea of rising above obstacles both literally and figuratively. However, the strong desire for flight might also indicate some tendency toward escapism or difficulty with commitment and follow-through. While the ability to leave any situation is liberating, it might also prevent you from developing the persistence that comes from working through challenges."

      "description": "You crave control over the fundamental forces of the universe - electricity, magnetism, and pure energy itself. Power flows through you and bends to your will.",
      "extended": "Your attraction to energy manipulation reveals someone who thinks about problems in terms of systems, power sources, and fundamental forces. You likely have a technical or scientific mindset and are drawn to understanding how things work at their most basic level. Energy control appeals to you because it represents mastery over the building blocks of reality itself.\n\nYou probably approach challenges by looking for the underlying mechanisms and power sources that drive them. Whether it's fixing a broken elevator, powering a dead phone, or stopping a runaway vehicle, you instinctively think about energy flows and how to redirect them. This power would let you solve problems by going straight to their energetic roots.\n\nYour choice suggests someone who values versatility and adaptability. Energy manipulation isn't just one power - it's the foundation for countless applications. You could generate electricity, create electromagnetic fields, power devices, or even influence electronic systems. This appeals to your desire for a universal solution that can adapt to any situation.\n\nThe preference for energy control also reveals someone who may feel disconnected from or frustrated by technology and systems that don't work properly. You might often think 'if I could just fix this directly' when dealing with malfunctioning devices or power outages. This power would eliminate your dependence on unreliable infrastructure and give you direct control over the energy that makes modern life possible."

      "extended": "Your attraction to shapeshifting reveals someone who values adaptability, creativity, and the freedom to reinvent yourself as needed. You likely feel constrained by having just one fixed form or identity and are drawn to the idea of being able to transform yourself to meet any challenge or opportunity. This power appeals to your desire for ultimate flexibility.\n\nYou probably have a creative, improvisational mindset and prefer solutions that allow you to adapt in real-time rather than following predetermined plans. Shapeshifting would let you become exactly what each situation requires - whether that's looking like someone else to blend in, becoming smaller to fit through tight spaces, or taking on forms better suited to specific tasks.\n\nYour choice suggests someone who may struggle with feeling limited by others' perceptions of who you are or what you're capable of. You might feel like people put you in boxes or expect you to always be the same person, when you know you contain multitudes. Shapeshifting would let you express different aspects of yourself as needed.\n\nThe preference for transformation also reveals someone who values authenticity but recognizes that sometimes adapting your presentation is necessary for survival or success. You understand that identity can be strategic and that there's wisdom in being able to become what a situation demands. However, this power might also appeal to someone who struggles with a stable sense of self or who uses adaptation as a way to avoid authentic vulnerability."

      "title": "The Life Restorer",
      "description": "You possess the deepest desire to heal - to mend what's broken, cure what's sick, and restore life and wholeness wherever you go. You're driven by compassion above all else.",
      "extended": "Your choice of healing powers reveals someone with profound empathy and a deep drive to reduce suffering in the world. You're likely highly sensitive to others' pain and may feel overwhelmed by your desire to help but limited by your current human capabilities. Healing represents the purest form of making a positive difference - directly restoring health, wholeness, and life.\n\nYou probably have a nurturing personality and may already work in a helping profession or find yourself naturally taking care of others. The idea of being able to instantly heal injuries, cure diseases, or restore someone's health appeals to your fundamental desire to make things better. This power would eliminate the helplessness you feel when watching others suffer.\n\nYour preference reveals someone who thinks about problems in terms of restoration and repair rather than destruction or force. Where others might choose powers that overcome obstacles, you choose the power that fixes what's broken. This indicates a fundamentally constructive and life-affirming worldview.\n\nThe attraction to healing might also reflect personal experience with illness, injury, or loss that left you feeling powerless to help. You may carry emotional wounds yourself and are drawn to the idea of being able to heal not just physical ailments but emotional and spiritual pain as well. This power represents hope - the belief that no damage is permanent and that wholeness can always be restored."

      "title": "The Future Seer",
      "description": "You crave the power to see what's coming - to know the consequences before making choices and never be caught off guard by life's surprises again.",
      "extended": "Your desire for precognition reveals someone who values preparation, planning, and the security that comes from knowing what to expect. You likely experience anxiety about uncertainty and would find great comfort in being able to see potential futures before they unfold. This power appeals to your need to feel prepared and in control of outcomes.\n\nYou probably spend a lot of mental energy trying to anticipate problems and plan for different scenarios. The ability to see the future would validate your natural planning instincts and give you the ultimate advantage in decision-making. You could avoid disasters, make perfect choices, and always know which path leads to the best outcomes.\n\nYour choice suggests someone who has been surprised or blindsided by events in the past and wants to ensure it never happens again. You may have learned that life can change suddenly and unpredictably, and precognition represents a way to regain some control over those unexpected changes.\n\nThe preference for seeing the future also reveals someone who thinks carefully about consequences and long-term effects. You understand that today's choices create tomorrow's reality, and you want the wisdom to choose well. However, this power might also appeal to someone who struggles with present-moment awareness or who uses future-planning as a way to avoid dealing with current challenges and emotions."

      "title": "The Elemental Master",
      "description": "You desire mastery over the fundamental forces of nature - fire, water, earth, and air. You want to command the elements themselves and work in harmony with natural power.",
      "extended": "Your attraction to elemental control reveals someone who feels a deep connection to nature and natural forces. You likely believe that working with natural systems is more powerful and sustainable than fighting against them. Elemental control appeals to you because it represents harmony between human will and natural power.\n\nYou probably approach problems by thinking about them in terms of natural processes and elemental balance. Fire for destruction and purification, water for healing and adaptation, earth for stability and strength, air for freedom and change. This power would let you solve problems by calling upon the appropriate natural force for each situation.\n\nYour choice suggests someone who values environmental consciousness and may feel frustrated by humanity's disconnection from natural systems. You might prefer solutions that work with natural processes rather than against them, and you're drawn to the idea of being able to directly command the elements that make life possible.\n\nThe preference for elemental control also reveals someone who appreciates the cyclical, balanced nature of natural systems. You understand that destruction and creation are both necessary parts of natural cycles, and you're comfortable with the idea of using both destructive and restorative forces as the situation demands. This power represents a holistic approach to problem-solving that considers the broader natural context of any challenge."
