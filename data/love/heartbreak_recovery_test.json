      "extended": "Your healing approach is rooted in emotional courage and authentic processing. You understand that healing isn't about getting over someone quickly, but about moving through the full spectrum of emotions that come with loss. You allow yourself to feel sadness, anger, confusion, and even moments of relief without judgment, recognizing that each emotion carries important information about your experience.\n\nYou're willing to sit with discomfort rather than numbing or avoiding it, which allows for deep, lasting healing rather than surface-level recovery. Your tears are not seen as weakness but as a necessary release that cleanses and heals your heart. You may spend longer in the initial stages of grief than others, but this thorough processing prevents unresolved emotions from affecting future relationships.\n\nYour approach honors the love you shared while gradually releasing attachment to the relationship itself. You understand that forgetting or dismissing the relationship would dishonor what you experienced, so instead you integrate the love and lessons into your evolving sense of self. This process transforms pain into wisdom and broken pieces into a more compassionate heart.\n\nWhen you emerge from this healing journey, you'll have a deeper capacity for empathy, emotional intelligence, and authentic connection. Your willingness to feel deeply becomes a superpower that allows you to love more fully and relate more genuinely with others who have experienced similar pain."

      "extended": "Your healing process is driven by a deep need to understand and make meaning from your experience. You believe that every relationship, even those that end, contains valuable lessons about love, compatibility, and personal growth. You spend considerable time analyzing what went wrong, what you contributed, and what you learned about yourself and your needs.\n\nYou're likely to journal extensively, perhaps even create timelines or lists of insights. You may read relationship books, take personality tests, or seek therapy to gain deeper understanding of your patterns and triggers. This intellectual approach to healing helps you feel more in control of your recovery and more prepared for future relationships.\n\nYour analytical nature helps you separate your worth from the relationship's outcome. You can objectively assess what worked and what didn't without taking the ending as a personal failure. This perspective allows you to maintain your self-esteem while still acknowledging areas for growth and improvement.\n\nWhile your approach is incredibly valuable for long-term growth, be mindful not to get stuck in analysis paralysis. Sometimes the heart needs to feel what the mind cannot understand. Your greatest strength lies in combining emotional processing with intellectual insight, creating a comprehensive understanding that serves both your healing and your future relationships."

You find that talking through your emotions, sharing your struggles, and receiving validation from trusted friends and family members helps you process the complex feelings that come with heartbreak.\n\nYou likely have a strong network of people who rally around you during difficult times, and you're not afraid to lean on them when you need support. You find comfort in hearing others' stories of heartbreak and recovery, knowing that you're not the first person to experience this pain and that others have emerged stronger on the other side.\n\nYour approach often involves group activities, heart-to-heart conversations, and finding community with others who understand what you're going through. You may join support groups, spend extra time with friends, or seek out others who have experienced similar losses. This communal approach to healing helps you feel less isolated and more hopeful about your recovery.\n\nWhile your relational approach to healing is deeply nurturing, be mindful of maintaining some independence in your recovery journey. Your friends and family are invaluable supports, but ultimately your healing must come from within. Use your community as a foundation while still developing your own internal resources for resilience and self-comfort."

      "extended": "Your healing approach prioritizes safety and self-protection above all else. You've learned that you can't heal in environments that continue to wound you, so you create clear boundaries around your time, energy, and emotional space. This might mean blocking your ex on social media, avoiding certain places or mutual friends, or limiting conversations about the relationship.\n\nYou understand that saying no to certain things allows you to say yes to your healing. You're selective about the media you consume, the people you spend time with, and the activities you engage in, choosing only those that support your recovery rather than trigger your pain. This discernment helps you create a cocoon of safety where your wounded heart can slowly mend.\n\nYour approach often involves creating new routines, establishing physical and emotional boundaries, and learning to advocate for your own needs even when others don't understand. You may need more alone time than usual, or you might be less available for social activities while you focus on your internal work.\n\nWhile your protective instincts serve you well during the acute phases of heartbreak, be mindful not to become so guarded that you shut out all possibility of future connection. Your boundaries should be flexible enough to expand as you heal, allowing for new relationships and experiences when you're ready. The goal is protection during vulnerability, not permanent isolation."

This activity helps you feel like you're making progress rather than just sitting with your pain.\n\nYou find that achieving small goals and completing tasks gives you a sense of control and self-efficacy during a time when so much feels uncertain. Whether it's reorganizing your living space, training for a race, or pursuing a promotion at work, these accomplishments help rebuild your confidence and sense of purpose.\n\nYour approach often involves setting concrete goals and timelines for your healing, treating your recovery like a project to be managed and completed. You may track your progress, celebrate milestones, and use external achievements as markers of your internal growth. This structure provides comfort and direction during the chaos of heartbreak.\n\nWhile staying productive can be incredibly healing, be mindful that you're not just avoiding your emotions through constant activity. Make sure to balance your goal-oriented healing with time for emotional processing and rest. The most sustainable recovery involves both doing and being, achieving and feeling. Your natural drive can be a powerful tool for healing when combined with authentic emotional work."

      "description": "You heal through solitude and deep self-discovery. You view this heartbreak as an opportunity to understand yourself better, explore your inner world, and emerge with greater self-awareness and wisdom.",
      "extended": "Your healing journey is primarily an inward one - you turn to solitude, reflection, and self-exploration to process your experience and grow from it. You see this time as a rare opportunity to deeply examine your patterns, desires, fears, and dreams without the influence of a romantic partner. You embrace the alone time as sacred space for personal development.\n\nYou might spend hours journaling, meditating, reading self-help books, or simply sitting quietly with your thoughts and feelings. You're curious about what this experience reveals about you - your attachment style, your needs in relationships, your core values, and your personal growth edges. You use this knowledge to consciously evolve into a more self-aware and intentional person.\n\nYour approach often involves exploring new aspects of yourself that may have been dormant during the relationship. You might discover new interests, reconnect with old passions, or develop skills and qualities that were overshadowed by your couple identity. This process of self-rediscovery can be both exciting and challenging as you learn to be fully yourself again.\n\nWhile your introspective approach leads to profound personal growth, be mindful of not becoming too isolated during your healing process. Your inner work is invaluable, but connection with others can provide perspective and support that enriches your self-discovery. Balance your solo reflection with meaningful interactions that help you integrate and share your insights."

      "description": "You heal through faith in better days ahead and trust in your own resilience. You naturally focus on the possibilities that this ending creates rather than dwelling on what you've lost.",
      "extended": "Your healing approach is fundamentally hopeful - you believe that this painful experience is temporary and that something better awaits you on the other side. You have a natural ability to see the silver linings and potential opportunities that come with this ending, even while acknowledging the very real pain you're experiencing.\n\nYou often focus on the future rather than the past, spending energy visualizing the life you want to create and the love you want to experience. You might make vision boards, set new goals, or plan adventures for your single life. This forward-looking perspective helps you feel excited about your future rather than trapped by your pain.\n\nYour optimism isn't naive - you understand that healing takes time and involves difficult emotions. But you trust in your own strength and resilience, knowing that you've overcome challenges before and will do so again. You often serve as a source of hope and inspiration for others going through similar experiences.\n\nWhile your positive outlook is a tremendous asset in healing, be careful not to bypass necessary grief work in your rush toward the future. Sometimes the path to genuine optimism requires moving through darkness rather than around it. Allow yourself to feel the full spectrum of emotions while maintaining your core belief that things will get better. Your hope becomes most powerful when it's grounded in authentic emotional processing."

      "extended": "Your healing approach is characterized by a deep wisdom and acceptance that goes beyond your years or experience. You understand that relationships sometimes end not because anyone is fundamentally flawed, but because of incompatibility, timing, or simply the natural evolution of two people's lives. This perspective helps you avoid the trap of blame and bitterness.\n\nYou focus on accepting reality as it is rather than fighting against what cannot be changed. This doesn't mean you're passive or that you don't feel pain - rather, you channel your energy into areas where you have agency: your own healing, growth, and future choices. You understand that acceptance is not resignation but rather a form of empowerment.\n\nYour approach often involves practices that cultivate peace and acceptance - perhaps meditation, time in nature, or spiritual practices that help you connect with something larger than your immediate pain. You're able to hold space for difficult emotions without being overwhelmed by them, and you often become a source of wisdom and comfort for others.\n\nWhile your mature perspective serves you well, be mindful not to bypass necessary emotional processing in your rush toward acceptance. Sometimes the path to genuine peace requires moving through anger, sadness, and other difficult emotions rather than immediately transcending them. Your wisdom becomes most powerful when it's grounded in authentic emotional experience rather than spiritual bypassing."

      "extended": "Your healing approach is revolutionary - you don't just want to get over this heartbreak, you want to use it as a launching pad for complete personal transformation. You see this ending as an opportunity to shed old patterns, limiting beliefs, and aspects of yourself that no longer serve you. You're committed to emerging from this experience fundamentally changed.\n\nYou might completely overhaul your lifestyle, appearance, career, or social circle as part of your healing process. You're not afraid of dramatic change and may actually crave it as a way of marking the distance between who you were in the relationship and who you're becoming. This process of reinvention helps you feel empowered and in control of your destiny.\n\nYour approach often involves setting ambitious goals for yourself and pursuing growth opportunities that push you outside your comfort zone. You might move to a new city, change careers, travel solo, or take on challenges that the old version of yourself would never have attempted. This bold approach to healing can lead to incredible personal growth and expanded possibilities.\n\nWhile your transformational approach can lead to profound positive change, be mindful of not running away from necessary emotional processing in your quest for reinvention. Make sure your changes are coming from genuine desire for growth rather than avoidance of pain. The most sustainable transformations are rooted in authentic self-knowledge and emotional integration, not just external change."

You find comfort in believing that everything happens for a reason and that this painful experience is somehow serving your highest good, even if you can't see how yet.\n\nYou might turn to prayer, meditation, spiritual texts, or guidance from spiritual mentors to help you understand and process this experience. You're interested in the deeper meaning and lessons rather than just the surface pain, and you often find that your spiritual practices provide comfort and perspective that purely secular approaches cannot.\n\nYour approach often involves surrender and trust in forces beyond your control. You might practice letting go through ritual, prayer, or meditation, trusting that the universe will guide you toward what's meant for you. This spiritual framework helps you find peace and purpose even in the midst of pain.\n\nWhile your spiritual approach can provide profound comfort and meaning, be careful not to use it to bypass necessary emotional work or human support. Sometimes spiritual platitudes can be used to avoid feeling difficult emotions or taking practical action. Your spiritual practice becomes most powerful when it complements rather than replaces emotional processing and psychological healing."

      "description": "You heal by staying busy and avoiding painful feelings whenever possible. You prefer to focus on anything other than the heartbreak itself, using distraction as your primary coping mechanism.",
      "extended": "Your healing approach centers around avoiding the direct experience of painful emotions by keeping yourself constantly occupied with other activities, people, or thoughts. You might throw yourself into work, social activities, new relationships, or addictive behaviors as a way of not having to sit with the discomfort of grief and loss.\n\nYou find that staying busy helps time pass more quickly and prevents you from spiraling into dark thoughts about the relationship or your ex. You might book every free moment with activities, binge-watch shows, scroll social media for hours, or party frequently as ways of keeping your mind off your pain. This approach can provide temporary relief from intense emotions.\n\nYour instinct is to move forward quickly rather than dwelling on what's behind you. You might start dating again immediately, make major life changes, or pursue new experiences as a way of proving to yourself and others that you're fine and moving on. You often appear to recover more quickly than others, at least on the surface.\n\nWhile avoidance can provide temporary relief, be aware that unprocessed emotions often resurface later in more intense forms. Your coping style may help you get through the acute phase of heartbreak, but long-term healing usually requires some degree of emotional processing. Consider gradually incorporating small amounts of feeling and reflection into your busy schedule to support deeper healing."

      "extended": "Your healing approach involves cherishing and preserving the positive aspects of your relationship rather than trying to forget or dismiss them entirely. You understand that the love you shared was real and meaningful, and you want to honor that even as you accept that the relationship has ended. You find comfort in remembering the good times and acknowledging what you learned and gained.\n\nYou might keep meaningful mementos, look through old photos occasionally, or allow yourself to remember happy moments without judgment. You're not trying to live in the past, but you also don't want to erase or minimize what was genuinely beautiful about your connection. This approach helps you maintain a balanced perspective on the relationship.\n\nYour healing often involves a gradual process of integrating the relationship into your life story as a meaningful chapter that's now closed. You work toward being able to think of your ex with fondness rather than pain, and to feel grateful for what you shared while still being open to new love in the future.\n\nWhile honoring your past love can be healing, be mindful of not getting stuck in nostalgia in a way that prevents you from moving forward. The goal is integration rather than fixation - being able to remember with warmth while still being present for new experiences and relationships. Your love for the past becomes most healthy when it coexists with excitement for the future."
