      "title": "The Love Addict",
      "description": "You experience love like a drug - intoxicating highs followed by devastating lows. You crave deep connection but live in constant fear of abandonment, creating a cycle of clingy behavior that often pushes partners away. Your relationships are emotional roller coasters where you check your phone obsessively, read hidden meanings into everything, and would rather be in a toxic relationship than be alone.",
      "detailed_analysis": "Your attachment style developed from early experiences where love felt unpredictable and conditional. You learned that affection could disappear without warning, creating a hypervigilant system that constantly scans for signs of rejection or abandonment. This creates exhausting patterns where you simultaneously crave and fear intimacy, desperately wanting closeness while being terrified it will disappear.\n\nYour relationships tend to follow predictable cycles - intense honeymoon phases where you feel euphoric and complete, followed by anxiety spirals when your partner shows any sign of independence or distance. You may find yourself constantly seeking reassurance, analyzing text message response times, or creating tests to see if your partner really loves you. This behavior often overwhelms partners who initially found your intensity attractive.\n\nYour greatest strength is your capacity for deep, passionate love and emotional connection. When you feel secure, you're incredibly giving, empathetic, and devoted. Your challenge is learning that love doesn't require constant proof and that healthy relationships include space for individual growth. You need partners who are consistent, patient, and willing to provide extra reassurance while you build internal security.\n\nHealing involves developing self-soothing skills, building confidence in your own worth, and learning to trust that love can be stable even when it's not constantly demonstrated. With conscious work, your intense capacity for love can become a beautiful gift rather than an overwhelming burden."

      "title": "The Relationship Unicorn",
      "description": "You're the rare breed that everyone wants to date but few know how to appreciate. You communicate your needs clearly, respect boundaries, and don't lose yourself in relationships. You're comfortable with both intimacy and independence, making you the ultimate relationship partner. Your exes probably still think about you - not because you left, but because you showed them what healthy love actually looks like.",
      "detailed_analysis": "Your secure attachment style is the gold standard of emotional health, developed through early experiences of consistent, responsive care. You learned that love is safe, reliable, and doesn't require you to sacrifice your identity or constantly prove your worth. This foundation allows you to approach relationships with confidence, openness, and realistic expectations.\n\nYou handle conflict constructively, viewing disagreements as opportunities to understand each other better rather than threats to the relationship. You can express your needs without manipulation, listen to your partner's concerns without becoming defensive, and maintain your sense of self while being genuinely intimate. This makes you incredibly attractive to both healthy and unhealthy partners.\n\nYour challenge often lies in recognizing and avoiding partners with insecure attachment styles who might drain your emotional resources. While your stability can be healing for anxious partners and your warmth can soften avoidant ones, you need to be careful not to become a caretaker or therapist in your relationships. You deserve a partner who matches your emotional maturity.\n\nYour relationships tend to be characterized by steady growth, mutual respect, and the ability to weather storms together. You understand that love is a choice made daily, not just a feeling, and you create the kind of partnership that others aspire to have. Your secure foundation allows you to love generously without losing yourself."

    "avoidant_attachment": {
      "title": "The Emotional Fortress",
      "description": "You've built walls so high that even you sometimes forget what's behind them. Independence is your drug, and emotional intimacy feels like suffocation. You're attracted to people who chase you but lose interest once they get close. Your relationships follow a predictable pattern: charm, withdraw, repeat. You'd rather be alone than vulnerable, but deep down you're terrified that your walls have become a prison.",
      "detailed_analysis": "Your avoidant attachment style developed as a protective mechanism against early experiences of emotional neglect, inconsistency, or overwhelming intensity. You learned that depending on others leads to disappointment and that emotional distance feels safer than vulnerability. While this protected you from pain, it also prevents you from experiencing the deep connection you secretly crave.\n\nYou typically enter relationships with enthusiasm but gradually withdraw as intimacy increases. You may find yourself picking fights when things get too close, becoming critical of your partner's 'flaws,' or simply losing interest once the chase is over. You prefer partners who are somewhat unavailable themselves, as this feels familiar and doesn't threaten your autonomy.\n\nYour greatest strength is your independence and ability to maintain your identity within relationships. You don't become clingy or lose yourself in love, which can be refreshing for partners used to more anxious attachment styles. However, your challenge is allowing yourself to be truly known and supported, which requires vulnerability you've learned to avoid.\n\nHealing involves gradually practicing emotional openness in safe relationships, recognizing that interdependence doesn't mean loss of self, and understanding that your need for space doesn't make you broken. Your capacity for independence, when balanced with emotional availability, can create incredibly strong and respectful partnerships."

      "title": "The Beautiful Chaos",
      "description": "You're a walking contradiction in love - desperately craving connection while simultaneously sabotaging it. Your relationships are intense, unpredictable, and often dramatic because you learned early that love and pain are intertwined. You're the person who says 'I love you' and 'I hate you' in the same conversation. Your attachment style is complex because your early experiences were complex, but this also makes you incredibly empathetic and capable of profound transformation.",
      "detailed_analysis": "Your disorganized attachment style developed from early experiences where your caregivers were both sources of comfort and fear. You learned to associate love with unpredictability, creating an internal system that simultaneously approaches and avoids intimacy. This creates the most challenging but also potentially transformative attachment pattern.\n\nYour relationships are characterized by intense highs and devastating lows, with little middle ground. You may find yourself alternating between desperate clinging and angry pushing away, often within the same conversation. You're attracted to drama because it feels familiar, but you also crave the stability you never experienced. This creates partnerships that are passionate but exhausting.\n\nYour greatest strength is your depth of feeling and capacity for transformation. You experience emotions more intensely than others, which can create profound empathy and the ability to connect with others' pain. You're also incredibly resilient, having survived complex early experiences that would overwhelm many people. Your challenge is learning to regulate these intense emotions and create stability within yourself.\n\nHealing involves developing emotional regulation skills, learning to sit with discomfort without creating chaos, and understanding that love can be both passionate and stable. With therapeutic support and conscious work, your intensity can become a source of deep connection rather than relationship destruction. Your journey toward security, while challenging, often leads to the most authentic and transformative relationships."
