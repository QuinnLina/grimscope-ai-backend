      "extended": "Your love language reveals a deep need for verbal connection and affirmation that goes far beyond surface-level compliments. You process love through language, and words carry profound emotional weight in your relationships. When someone tells you they love you, appreciate you, or find you attractive, it doesn't just make you happy - it actually fills your emotional tank and gives you the confidence to face the world.\n\nYou're naturally gifted at expressing appreciation and making others feel valued through your words. You notice details about people that others miss, and you have an intuitive understanding of how powerful words can be in building someone up or tearing them down. Your partners often feel truly seen and appreciated because of your verbal gifts, and you create emotional safety through consistent positive communication.\n\nHowever, you're also more vulnerable to verbal wounds than most people realize. Harsh words, criticism delivered poorly, or long periods of silence from loved ones can send you into emotional tailspins. You may find yourself replaying negative comments for days or weeks, while positive words can sustain you through difficult times. You screenshot loving texts, save voicemails, and hold onto written expressions of love like treasures.\n\nYour ideal partner understands that regular verbal affirmation isn't neediness - it's how you best receive and process love. They tell you specific things they appreciate about you, express their feelings clearly and frequently, and understand that their words have the power to either build you up or tear you down. They see your need for verbal connection as a beautiful aspect of your emotional depth rather than something to be minimized or criticized."

      "description": "You believe that actions speak louder than words because effort is the truest expression of love. When someone takes care of your responsibilities, solves your problems, or makes your life easier, you feel deeply cherished.",
      "extended": "Your love language centers around the profound truth that love is a verb, not just a feeling. You understand that anyone can say 'I love you,' but it takes genuine care and effort to prove it through consistent helpful actions. When someone anticipates your needs, handles responsibilities for you, or goes out of their way to make your life easier, you feel truly valued and prioritized in their life.\n\nYou're naturally attuned to practical needs and have an instinct for helpful action. You express love by doing things - cooking meals, handling errands, fixing problems, or taking care of tasks that stress your loved ones. You find deep satisfaction in being useful and supportive, and you often show love by removing burdens from the people you care about. Your love is reliable, consistent, and demonstrated through tangible actions rather than grand gestures.\n\nHowever, you can become deeply hurt and resentful when your efforts aren't reciprocated or appreciated. When partners make promises they don't keep, expect you to handle everything alone, or fail to notice the countless ways you make their lives easier, you feel taken for granted and unloved. You may start keeping mental scorecards of who does what, and you can become passive-aggressive when you feel like you're giving more than you're receiving.\n\nYour ideal partner recognizes that your acts of service aren't just helpfulness - they're love letters written in action. They reciprocate by helping you with tasks, following through on commitments, and actively looking for ways to make your life easier. They understand that when you ask for help, you're not being lazy - you're asking them to love you in the language you understand best."

You can instantly tell the difference between someone spending time with you and someone being present with you. When you have someone's complete, undivided attention, you feel loved in the most profound way possible.\n\nYou're highly sensitive to the quality of attention you receive. You notice when people are multitasking during conversations, when they're distracted by phones or screens, or when they seem mentally elsewhere even while physically present. Conversely, when someone puts away distractions to focus entirely on you, makes eye contact during conversations, and gives you their full attention, you feel deeply valued and connected.\n\nYou express love by being fully present with others - listening deeply, asking meaningful questions, and creating space for authentic connection. You're often the person in relationships who suggests putting phones away during dinner, who wants to talk through issues rather than avoiding them, and who values deep conversation over small talk. Your relationships are characterized by emotional intimacy and genuine understanding.\n\nHowever, you can become hurt and disconnected when you feel like you're competing with distractions for someone's attention. Busy partners, people who are always on their phones, or those who prefer surface-level interactions can leave you feeling lonely even when you're together. Your ideal partner understands that giving you their focused attention isn't just nice - it's how they love you most effectively."

      "extended": "Your love language is deeply connected to the profound emotional power of physical touch and connection. For you, physical affection isn't just pleasant - it's how you process emotional intimacy and feel most securely connected to others. Touch communicates safety, love, and acceptance in ways that words often cannot, and you have an intuitive understanding of how powerful physical connection can be.\n\nYou naturally express love through physical affection - holding hands, giving hugs, cuddling while watching movies, or simply sitting close to people you care about. You're often the one who initiates physical contact, and you have a gift for using touch to comfort others and create emotional connection. Your physical expressions of love are genuine and come from a place of deep emotional care.\n\nYou're highly sensitive to physical rejection or withdrawal. When someone pulls away from your touch, rejects your physical advances, or creates physical distance, you often interpret it as emotional rejection as well. Conversely, when someone initiates physical contact with you, welcomes your touch, and maintains regular physical affection, you feel deeply loved and secure in the relationship.\n\nYour need for physical touch can sometimes be misunderstood as being overly sexual or clingy, when in reality it's about emotional connection and security. Your ideal partner understands that your need for regular physical affection is part of how you're wired to connect, and they're comfortable with both giving and receiving physical expressions of love. They see your physically affectionate nature as a gift rather than neediness."

      "extended": "Your love language centers around the profound emotional meaning behind thoughtful gestures and gifts.

You're often the person who remembers birthdays, brings back souvenirs from trips, or picks up little things that remind you of people you care about.

You notice when people forget special dates, never bring you anything, or give obviously last-minute or thoughtless gifts. Your ideal partner understands that your appreciation for gifts isn't about materialism - it's about feeling remembered, understood, and valued enough to merit their time and thoughtful effort."

They're willing to share their authentic selves, work through emotional challenges together, and create a relationship where both people can grow and evolve safely.
